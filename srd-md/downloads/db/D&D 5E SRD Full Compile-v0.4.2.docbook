      <title>Racial Traits</title>
      <para>
        The description of each race includes racial traits that are
        common to members of that race. The following entries appear
        among the traits of most races.

      <section xml:id="ability-score-increase">
        <title>Ability Score Increase</title>
        <para>
          Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability
          scores.
        </para>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="age">
        <title>Age</title>
        <para>
          The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is
          considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan.
          This information can help you decide how old your character is
          at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your
          character, which could provide an explanation for some of your
          ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old
          character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength
          or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a
          high Intelligence or Wisdom.

        <title>Alignment</title>
        <para>
          Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments,
          described in this entry. These are not binding for player
          characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for
          example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you
          better define your character.

        <para>
          Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including
          creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few
          races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that
          certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most
          important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble
          wielding heavy weapons, as explained in

        <para>
          Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits
          of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for
          their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly
          from race to race and world to world.

        Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a

        Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark

        You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is

        Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Age</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as
        humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond
        physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf
        typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of
        100 and can live to be 750 years old.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Alignment</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so they lean
        strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and
        protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more
        often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile has
        made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than
        not.
      </para>
      <para>

        Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have

        light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
        darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Trance</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply,
        remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for
        such meditation is <quote>trance.</quote>) While meditating, you
        can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental
        exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.
      </para>

        After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a
        human does from 8 hours of sleep.

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Languages</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is
        fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven
        literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are
        famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so
        they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

        As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least
        the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are
        two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive,
        believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other

        Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted

        You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling
        language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with
        others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body
        of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong.
        Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in

        When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of

        Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters,

        In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can
        enter a rage as a bonus action.

        While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t

            When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain
            a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels
            as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the
            Barbarian table.

      <para>
        Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked
        unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a
        hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since
        then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian
        level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must
        finish a long rest before you can rage again.

      <title>Unarmored Defense</title>
      <para>
        While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10
        + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can
        use a shield and still gain this benefit.

    <section xml:id="reckless-attack">
      <title>Reckless Attack</title>
      <para>
        Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for
        defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your
        first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly.
        Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using
        Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have
        advantage until your next turn.

    <section xml:id="danger-sense">
      <title>Danger Sense</title>
      <para>
        At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby
        aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away
        from danger.
      </para>
      <para>
        You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects
        that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this
        benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

      <title>Primal Path</title>
      <para>
        At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your
        rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem
        Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your
        choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th,
        and 14th levels.

        When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
        level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2,
        or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
        normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this
        feature.

        By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have
        advantage on initiative rolls.
      </para>
      <para>
        Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat
        and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first
        turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else
        on that turn.

        damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit
        with a melee attack.

        This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three
        additional dice at 17th level.

      <title>Relentless Rage</title>
      <para>
        Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite
        grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging
        and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving
        throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases
        by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

    <section xml:id="persistent-rage">

        <title>Path of the Berserker</title>
        <para>
          For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end- that end being
          violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled
          fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you
          thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or
          well-being.

          <title>Frenzy</title>
          <para>
            Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go
            into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration
            of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a
            bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your
            rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described
            in appendix A).

            Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened
            while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you
            enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of
            the rage.

          <title>Intimidating Presence</title>
          <para>
            Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten
            someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose
            one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the
            creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom
            saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
            Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of
            your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action
            to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened
            creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends
            if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more
            than 60 feet away from you.
          </para>
          <para>
            If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use
            this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

        You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do
        so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature
        other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That
        creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die
        and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or
        saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it
        rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die,
        but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or
        fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A
        creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use this feature a number of times equal to your

        uses when you finish a long rest.

        or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain
        hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more

        can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next

        <para>
          Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things,
          collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as
          scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk
          ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts,
          these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When
          the applause dies down, the audience members might find
          themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from
          their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their
          loyalty to the king.
        </para>
        <para>
          The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and
          truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a
          deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor
          knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.

          The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in
          actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to
          share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals
          or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel
          lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

            Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to
            distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and
            competence of others. When a creature that you can see
            within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability
            check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend
            one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic
            Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the
            creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after
            the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines
            whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails,
            or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is
            immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being

          At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the

        <para>
          The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
          your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
          these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or
          higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
          long rest.
        </para>
        <para>
          You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for
          you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do
          so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom
          modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The
          spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
        </para>
        <para>
          For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
          1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16,
          your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or
          2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level
          spell <emphasis>cure wounds</emphasis>, you can cast it using
          a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
          remove it from your list of prepared spells.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a
          long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time
          spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell
          level for each spell on your list.

          your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom

        Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light,
        Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at
        the end of the class description, and each one provides examples
        of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells
        and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also
        grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain
        that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th,
        and 17th levels.

          Each domain has a list of spells - its domain spells - that

          it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare
          each day.

      <para>
        At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy
        directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical
        effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an
        effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you
        additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the
        domain description.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to
        create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your
        Channel Divinity again.
      </para>
      <para>
        Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you
        use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric
        spell save DC.
      </para>
      <para>
        Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice
        between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three
        times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you
        regain your expended uses.

          censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you
          within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the
          creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or
          until it takes any damage.

          A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far
          away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a
          space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For
          its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape
          from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s
          nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

            Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more
            effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher
            to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains
            additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

            Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
            heal the badly injured.

          <para>
            As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing
            energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five
            times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet
            of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature
            can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point
            maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a
            construct.

            Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on
            others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level
            or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than
            you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

            At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
            strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when
            you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the
            attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target.
            When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to
            2d8.

            Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or
            more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead
            use the highest number possible for each die. For example,
            instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you
            restore 12.

      <para>
        You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak
        the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others
        who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others
        spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom
        (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

        Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast

        <para>
          At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the
          druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your
          choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column
          of the Druid table.

        <title>Preparing and Casting Spells</title>
        <para>
          The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
          your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
          these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s
          level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
          finish a long rest.
        </para>
        <para>
          You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for
          you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do
          so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom
          modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells
          must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
        </para>
        <para>
          For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four
          1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16,
          your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or
          2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level
          spell <emphasis>cure wounds</emphasis>, you can cast it using
          a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
          remove it from your list of prepared spells.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can also change your list of prepared spells when you
          finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells
          requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
          minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

        Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since
        your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature.
        You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
        ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting
        the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making
        an attack roll with one.

      <para>
        Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically
        assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can
        use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish
        a short or long rest.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into,
        as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example,
        you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of
        1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.

        You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to
        half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your
        normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You
        can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action
        on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious,
        drop to 0 hit points, or die.

          <para>
            Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the
            beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and
            Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain
            all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in
            addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature
            has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat
            block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead
            of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions,
            you can’t use them.

            When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and
            Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to
            the number of hit points you had before you transformed.
            However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit
            points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
            For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have
            only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long
            as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0
            hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

            You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any
            action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of
            your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your
            concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or
            prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell,
            such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.

            You retain the benefit of any features from your class,
            race, or other source and can use them if the new form is
            physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any
            of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new
            form also has that sense.

            You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in
            your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it.
            Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides
            whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of
            equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your
            equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new
            form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must
            either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that
            merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

        At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids:
        the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed
        at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you
        features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

        Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells
        in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the
        somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast
        shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.

        Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components
        of your druid spells, as well as any material components that
        lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this
        benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild

          The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who
          safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral
          tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or
          standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The
          circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of
          communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors
          to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your
          magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into
          the circle’s mysterious rites.

          <title>Natural Recovery</title>
          <para>
            Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical
            energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature.
            During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to
            recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is
            equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up),
            and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t
            use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
          </para>
          <para>
            For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover
            up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover
            either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

            Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the
            ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th
            level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land
            where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast,
            desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult
            the associated list of spells.
          </para>
          <para>
            Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it
            prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells
            you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that
            doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is
            nonetheless a druid spell for you.

            Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult
            terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass
            through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and
            without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines,
            or a similar hazard.

          <para>
            In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against
            plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede
            movement, such those created by the
            <emphasis>entangle</emphasis> spell.

          <para>
            When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world
            sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to
            attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that
            creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid
            spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a
            different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a
            successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for
            24 hours.
          </para>
          <para>
            The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its

            <para>
              <emphasis role="strong">Sacred Plants and Wood</emphasis>
            </para>
            <para>
              A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly
              alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper,
              mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use
              such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating
              lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.
            </para>
            <para>
              Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects,
              such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death
              and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles
              might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life
              and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or
              whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as
              shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be
              used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.
            </para>
            <para>
              Druids from regions that lack the plants described here
              have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For
              instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca
              tree and cactus plants.

            </para>
            <para>
              Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but
              most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities
              worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix
              B include many such deities). The worship of these deities
              is often considered a more ancient tradition than the
              faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.

            a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action

        connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with
        a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you

        The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a
        noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in
        your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect
        such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the
        location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of
        you that is not behind total cover. You know the type
        (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you
        sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von
        Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect
        the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or
        desecrated, as with the <emphasis>hallow</emphasis> spell.

        As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the

        Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of

        neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands,

        <para>
          The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
          your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st
          level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level
          or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish
          a long rest.
        </para>
        <para>
          You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for
          you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do
          so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma
          modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of
          one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have
          spell slots.
        </para>
        <para>
          For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four
          1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of
          14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of
          1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the
          1st-level spell <emphasis>cure wounds</emphasis>, you can cast
          it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell
          doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a
          long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires

        damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The

      <title>Sacred Oaths</title>
      <para>
        Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin
        to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting
        wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd
        level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some
        characters with this class don’t consider themselves true
        paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath.
        For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an
        official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s
        heart.

        <para>
          The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of
          justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white
          knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of
          the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of
          justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the
          highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse,
          hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who
          swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use
          their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold
          angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and
          incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or
          coats of arms.

            <para>
              A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of
              conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible.
              Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a
              situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes
              the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or
              her oath.
            </para>
            <para>
              A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution
              from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another
              paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-
              night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake
              a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of
              confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
            </para>
            <para>
              If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows

              serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin
              might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.

      <para>
        Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult
        terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through
        nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without
        taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a
        similar hazard.
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants
        that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement,
        such those created by the <emphasis>entangle</emphasis> spell.

      <title>Hide in Plain Sight</title>
      <para>
        Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating
        camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud,
        dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with
        which to create your camouflage.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by
        pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or
        wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a
        +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain
        there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an
        action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain
        this benefit.

        Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus
        action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical
        means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

        At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight
        creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t
        see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on
        your attack rolls against it.
      </para>
      <para>
        You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature
        within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden
        from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.

        At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your
        enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom
        modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you
        make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use
        this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of

          Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a

          wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn
          specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from

      <para>
        At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of
        your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’
        tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check
        you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
      </para>
      <para>
        At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in

      <title>Sneak Attack</title>
      <para>
        Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and
        exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an
        extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you
        have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse
        or a ranged weapon.
      </para>
      <para>
        You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of
        the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t
        incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack
        roll.
      </para>
      <para>
        The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in
        this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue
        table.

    <section xml:id="thieves-cant">
      <title>Thieves’ Cant</title>
      <para>
        During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret
        mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide
        messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature
        that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes
        four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak
        the same idea plainly.
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols
        used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area
        is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot
        is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or
        will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

        Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you
        to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of
        your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the
        Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

        exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane
        Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description.
        Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then

        certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an
        <emphasis>ice storm</emphasis> spell. When you are subjected to
        an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to
        take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed
        on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

        lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of
        9 or lower as a 10.

        advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.

    <section xml:id="stroke-of-luck">
      <title>Stroke of Luck</title>
      <para>
        At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you
        need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can
        turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability
        check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

      <para>
        Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on
        perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to
        combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different
        rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by
        the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection
        of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen
        profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

      <section xml:id="thief">

          You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits,
          cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this
          archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves
          as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and
          investigators. In addition to improving your agility and
          stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient
          ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you
          normally couldn’t employ.

            lock, or take the Use an Object action.

            When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the

        Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate

        <title>Draconic Bloodline</title>
        <para>
          Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled
          with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often,
          sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a
          mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a
          dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of
          these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most
          are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new
          bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional

          each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you

          You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by

          perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be
          done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon,
          shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears
          whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t
          affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The
          weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you
          perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use
          a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears

          While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips

          If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour

          You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows.
          Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any
          class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list).
          The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the
          number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand,
          you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the
          spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some
          other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a
          ritual if it has the ritual tag.
        </para>
        <para>
          On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your
          Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to
          the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half
          your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time
          to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the
          transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the
          rare inks needed to inscribe it.

          <para>
            Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an
            attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the
            target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and
            hurtles through a nightmare landscape.
          </para>
          <para>
            At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the
            space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied
            space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic
            damage as it reels from its horrific experience.
          </para>
          <para>
            Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
            finish a long rest.

              Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an
              object that reflects your patron’s nature.

              Chain</emphasis></emphasis>. Your familiar is more cunning
              than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a
              reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons
              tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the
              Fiend. Because the Great Old One’s nature is inscrutable,
              any familiar form is suitable for it.

              Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in
              leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be
              an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative
              flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon
              might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone
              embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible
              unblinking eye.

              a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and
              illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be
              a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron,
              holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden
              lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of
              the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic
              driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding
              scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity
              allows you to understand and cast.

          At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level
          wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository

        <para>
          The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
          your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
          these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or
          higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
          long rest.
        </para>
        <para>
          You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for
          you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from
          your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your
          wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a
          level for which you have spell slots.

        <para>
          For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four
          1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence
          of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of
          1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your
          spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <emphasis>magic
          missile</emphasis>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a
          2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your
          list of prepared spells.

        <para>
          You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a

          spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations
          and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1

        You can cast those spells at their lowest level without

        categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are
        literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of
        Illusion while another studies across town at the School of
        Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like
        academic departments, with rival faculties competing for
        students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the
        solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into
        schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school
        require mastery of different techniques.

          You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental
          effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder,
          crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find
          employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast
          enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to
          protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits,
          adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.

            Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold

            Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative
            safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you
            cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that
            you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 +
            the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically
            succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they
            take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a
            successful save.

            Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even
            creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a
            creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip,
            the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but
            suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

            Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your
            simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through
            5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage
            with that spell.
          </para>

            The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If
            you use this feature again before you finish a long rest,
            you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell,
            immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this
            feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic
            damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage
            ignores resistance and immunity.

    <title>Multiclassing</title>
    <para>
      Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing
      so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a
      character concept that might not be reflected in one of the
      standard class options.
    </para>
    <para>
      With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new
      class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in
      your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added
      together to determine your character level. For example, if you
      have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level
      character.
    </para>
    <para>
      As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of
      your original class with just a few levels in another class, or
      you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class
      you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or
      fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same
      level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

        To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score
        prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as
        shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a
        barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must
        have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without
        the full training that a beginning character receives, you must
        be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude
        that is reflected by higher- than-average ability scores.

        5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you
        Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If

    <title>Class Features</title>
    <para>
      When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for
      that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting
      equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re
      multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense,
      and Spellcasting.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="channel-divinity-3">
      <title>Channel Divinity</title>
      <para>
        If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a
        level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the
        Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the
        feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain
        additional uses only when you reach a class level that
        explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric
        6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests
        because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have
        more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of
        the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two
        classes.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="extra-attack-5">
      <title>Extra Attack</title>
      <para>
        If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one
        class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than
        two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the
        fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the
        warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you
        additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="unarmored-defense-2">
      <title>Unarmored Defense</title>
      <para>
        If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t
        gain it again from another class.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="spellcasting-7">
      <title>Spellcasting</title>
      <para>
        Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined
        levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your
        individual levels in those classes. Once you have the
        Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules
        below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from
        only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Spells Known and
        Prepared</emphasis></emphasis>. You determine what spells you
        know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were
        a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger
        4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells
        based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard,
        you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten
        wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached
        3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your
        Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your
        spellbook.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your
        classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when
        you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a
        holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class
        associated with that focus.
      </para>
      <para>
        If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the
        increase is based on your character level, not your level in a
        particular class
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Spell
        Slots</emphasis></emphasis>. You determine your available spell
        slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric,
        druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels
        (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total
        to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass
        Spellcaster table.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might
        give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells
        you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to
        cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you
        cast, like <emphasis>burning hands</emphasis>, has an enhanced
        effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the
        enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that
        higher level.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3,
        you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell
        slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and
        two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level
        spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use
        the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do
        know-and potentially enhance their effects.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Pact
        Magic</emphasis></emphasis>. If you have both the Spellcasting
        class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock
        class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic
        feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes
        with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell
        slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast
        warlock spells you know.

      You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that
      feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that
      feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler
      feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your
      Strength is reduced below 13 somehow-perhaps by a withering
      curse-you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength
      is restored.

    <title>Alignment</title>
    <para>
      A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which
      broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a
      combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil,
      or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and
      order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct
      alignments define the possible combinations.
    </para>
    <para>
      These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical
      behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary
      significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are
      perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their
      alignment.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Lawful good</emphasis> (LG) creatures can
      be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold
      dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Neutral good</emphasis> (NG) folk do the
      best they can to help others according to their needs. Many
      celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Chaotic good</emphasis> (CG) creatures act
      as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others
      expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Lawful neutral</emphasis> (LN) individuals
      act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many
      monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Neutral</emphasis> (N) is the alignment of
      those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take
      sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids,
      and many humans are neutral.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Chaotic neutral</emphasis> (CN) creatures

      Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.

      <emphasis role="strong">Lawful evil</emphasis> (LE) creatures
      methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of

      are lawful evil.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Neutral evil</emphasis> (NE) is the
      alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without
      compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins
      are neutral evil.

    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Chaotic evil</emphasis> (CE) creatures act
      with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or
      bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.

    <section xml:id="alignment-in-the-multiverse">
      <title>Alignment in the Multiverse</title>
      <para>
        For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice.
        Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose
        whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos.
        According to myth, the good- aligned gods who created these
        races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing
        that good without free will is slavery.
      </para>
      <para>
        The evil deities who created other races, though, made those
        races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies
        that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the
        violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined
        toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it
        struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life.
        (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s
        influence.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and
        fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it
        doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in
        its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would
        cease to be a devil.
      </para>
      <para>
        Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do
        not have alignments-they are
        <emphasis role="strong">unaligned</emphasis>. Such a creature is
        incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according
        to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example,
        but they are not evil; they have no alignment.

  <section xml:id="languages-1">
    <title>Languages</title>
    <para>
      Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by
      default, and your background might give you access to one or more
      additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your
      character sheet.
    </para>
    <para>
      Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose
      one that is common in your campaign. With your GM’s permission,
      you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table
      or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of
      druids.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some of these languages are actually families of languages with
      many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the
      Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four
      elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the
      same language can communicate with one another.

      Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for
      playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her
      personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration,
      you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the
      downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar
      Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the
      defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell
      that has been laid on you.

      <title>Gaining Inspiration</title>
      <para>
        Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of
        reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your
        personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw
        or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling
        way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the
        game.

        Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another

        something exciting in the game. When another player character
        does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and
        interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that
        character inspiration.

      Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals

      a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an
      artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or
      commanded audiences as a jester.

      Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about
      your character’s identity. The most important question to ask

      did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start
      adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting

        either use the equipment package from your background or spend
        coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you
        spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested
        for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one
        ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that
        matches your desired background, work with your GM to create
        one.

      <para>
        You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a
        specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary
        between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing
        sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct
        worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not
        necessarily a cleric - performing sacred rites is not the same
        thing as channeling divine power.
      </para>
      <para>
        Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine
        being from among those listed in <quote>Fantasy-Historical
        Pantheons</quote> or those specified by your GM, and work with
        your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you
        a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to
        assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high
        priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a
        different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult
        outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult
        group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.

          As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your
          faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your
          deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to
          receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other
          established presence of your faith, though you must provide
          any material components needed for spells. Those who share
          your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest
          lifestyle.

          You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to
          your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there.
          This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you
          remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found
          a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the
          priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is
          not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your
          temple.

          Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other

          hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws

      <para>
        Common coins come in several different denominations based on
        the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The
        three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver
        piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
      </para>
      <para>
        With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of
        good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan
        can earn one gold piece a day. The old piece is the standard
        unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not
        commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods
        or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the
        transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of individual
        coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value,
        and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or
        valuable goods.
      </para>
      <para>
        One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent
        coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer’s work for
        half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor
        inn.

        One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common
        among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle,
        a torch, or a piece of chalk.
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals
        sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and
        the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost
        kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism
        when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five
        silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
      </para>
      <para>
        A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins
        weigh a pound.

      <title>Selling Treasure</title>
      <para>
        Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons,
        armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can
        sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or
        other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and
        merchants interested in your loot.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Arms, Armor, and Other
        Equipment</emphasis></emphasis>. As a general rule, undamaged
        weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when
        sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely
        in good enough condition to sell.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Magic
        Items</emphasis></emphasis>. Selling magic items is problematic.
        Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but
        other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest
        nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t
        normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The
        value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be
        treated as such.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Gems, Jewelry, and Art
        Objects</emphasis></emphasis>. These items retain their full
        value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for
        coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For
        exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to
        find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

    <title>Armor</title>
    <para>
      Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many
      different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this
      reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types,
      ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor,
      with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table
      collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the
      game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium
      armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with
      a shield.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of
      the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Armor
      Proficiency</emphasis></emphasis>. Anyone can put on a suit of
      armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the
      armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class
      gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear
      armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any
      ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength
      or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Armor Class
      (AC)</emphasis></emphasis>. Armor protects its wearer from
      attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base
      Armor Class.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Heavy
      Armor</emphasis></emphasis>. Heavier armor interferes with the
      wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the
      Armor table shows <quote>Str 13</quote> or <quote>Str 15</quote>
      in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the
      wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score
      equal to or higher than the listed score.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Stealth</emphasis></emphasis>.
      If the Armor table shows <quote>Disadvantage</quote> in the
      Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
      checks.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Shields</emphasis></emphasis>. A
      shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand.
      Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit
      from only one shield at a time.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="light-armor">
      <title>Light Armor</title>
      <para>
        Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile
        adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing
        mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity
        modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine
        your Armor Class.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Padded</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Leather</emphasis></emphasis>.
        The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made
        of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The
        rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Studded
        Leather</emphasis></emphasis>. Made from tough but flexible
        leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or
        spikes.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="medium-armor">
      <title>Medium Armor</title>
      <para>
        Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it
        also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add
        your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number
        from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Hide</emphasis></emphasis>.
        This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is
        commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other
        folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create
        better armor.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Chain
        Shirt</emphasis></emphasis>. Made of interlocking metal rings, a
        chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This
        armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and
        allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be
        muffled by outer layers.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Scale
        Mail</emphasis></emphasis>. This armor consists of a coat and
        leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with
        overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The
        suit includes gauntlets.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Breastplate</emphasis></emphasis>.
        This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with
        supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively
        unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the
        wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively
        unencumbered.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Half
        Plate</emphasis></emphasis>. Half plate consists of shaped metal
        plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include
        leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with
        leather straps.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="heavy-armor">
      <title>Heavy Armor</title>
      <para>
        Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best
        protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are
        designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient
        warriors can manage their weight and bulk.
      </para>
      <para>
        Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your
        Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity
        modifier is negative.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Ring
        Mail</emphasis></emphasis>. This armor is leather armor with
        heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor
        against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to
        chain mail, and it’s usually worn only by those who can’t afford
        better armor.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Chain
        Mail</emphasis></emphasis>. Made of interlocking metal rings,
        chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath
        the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows.
        The suit includes gauntlets.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Splint</emphasis></emphasis>.
        This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to
        a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible
        chain mail protects the joints.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Plate</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the
        entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather
        boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath
        the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the
        body.

  <section xml:id="weapons">
    <title>Weapons</title>
    <para>
      Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both
      the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use.
      Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your
      ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between
      life and death while adventuring.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the
      fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they
      deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every
      weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A
      <emphasis role="strong">melee weapon</emphasis> is used to attack
      a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a
      <emphasis role="strong">ranged weapon</emphasis> is used to attack
      a target at a distance.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="weapon-proficiency">
      <title>Weapon Proficiency</title>
      <para>
        Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with
        certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are
        <emphasis role="strong">simple</emphasis> and
        <emphasis role="strong">martial</emphasis>. Most people can use
        simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs,
        maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners.
        Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require
        more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use
        martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style
        and training to best use.
      </para>
      <para>
        Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency
        bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that
        weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you
        lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the
        attack roll.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="weapon-properties">
      <title>Weapon Properties</title>
      <para>
        Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as
        shown in the Weapons table.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Ammunition</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a
        ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the
        weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one
        piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case,
        or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand
        to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can
        recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to
        search the battlefield.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a
        melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see
        <quote>Improvised Weapons</quote> later in the section). A sling
        must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Finesse</emphasis></emphasis>.
        When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice
        of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage
        rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Heavy</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy
        weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a
        Small creature to use effectively.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Light</emphasis></emphasis>. A
        light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for
        use when fighting with two weapons.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Loading</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire
        only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action,
        bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number
        of attacks you can normally make.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Range</emphasis></emphasis>. A
        weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in
        parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range
        lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in
        feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When
        attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on
        the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s
        long range.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Reach</emphasis></emphasis>.
        This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it,
        as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks
        with it.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Special</emphasis></emphasis>.
        A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing
        its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see
        <quote>Special Weapons</quote> later in this section).
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Thrown</emphasis></emphasis>.
        If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to
        make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use
        the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll
        that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For
        example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if
        you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your
        Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Two-Handed</emphasis></emphasis>.
        This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Versatile</emphasis></emphasis>.
        This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in
        parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon
        is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
      </para>
      <section xml:id="improvised-weapons">
        <title>Improvised Weapons</title>
        <para>
          Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to
          attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes
          any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken
          glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead
          goblin.
        </para>
        <para>
          Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and
          can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a
          club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon
          can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his
          or her proficiency bonus.
        </para>
        <para>
          An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4
          damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the
          object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee
          attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown
          property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown
          weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60
          feet.
        </para>
        <section xml:id="silvered-weapons">
          <title>Silvered Weapons</title>
          <para>
            Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical
            weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious
            adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with
            silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of
            ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the
            price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to
            add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Lance</emphasis></emphasis>.
            You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a
            target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two
            hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.
          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Net</emphasis></emphasis>.
            A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until
            it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are
            formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature
            can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing
            itself or another creature within its reach on a success.
            Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the
            creature without harming it, ending the effect and
            destroying the net.
          </para>
          <para>
            When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack
            with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the
            number of attacks you can normally make.

    <title>Adventuring Gear</title>
    <para>
      This section describes items that have special rules or require
      further explanation.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Acid</emphasis></emphasis>. As
      an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a
      creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet,
      shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack
      against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised
      weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Alchemist’s
      Fire</emphasis></emphasis>. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites
      when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to
      20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a
      creature or object, treating the alchemist’s fire as an improvised
      weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of
      each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its
      action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Antitoxin</emphasis></emphasis>.
      A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on
      saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to
      undead or constructs.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Arcane
      Focus</emphasis></emphasis>. An arcane focus is a special item-an
      orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like
      length of wood, or some similar item- designed to channel the
      power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use
      such an item as a spellcasting focus.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Ball
      Bearings</emphasis></emphasis>. As an action, you can spill these
      tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area
      that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered
      area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
      A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to
      make the save.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Block and
      Tackle</emphasis></emphasis>. A set of pulleys with a cable
      threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and
      tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can
      normally lift.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Book</emphasis></emphasis>. A
      book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information
      pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on
      gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be
      represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a
      spellbook (described later in this section).
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Caltrops</emphasis></emphasis>.
      As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square
      area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area
      must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this
      turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the
      creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at
      least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half
      speed doesn’t need to make the save.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Candle</emphasis></emphasis>.
      For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim
      light for an additional 5 feet.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Case, Crossbow
      Bolt</emphasis></emphasis>. This wooden case can hold up to twenty
      crossbow bolts.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Case, Map or
      Scroll</emphasis></emphasis>. This cylindrical leather case can
      hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets
      of parchment.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Chain</emphasis></emphasis>. A
      chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20
      Strength check.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Climber’s
      Kit</emphasis></emphasis>. A climber’s kit includes special
      pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the
      climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you
      can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored
      yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that
      point without undoing the anchor.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Component
      Pouch</emphasis></emphasis>. A component pouch is a small,
      watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all
      the material components and other special items you need to cast
      your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost
      (as indicated in a spell’s description).
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Crowbar</emphasis></emphasis>.
      Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the
      crowbar’s leverage can be applied.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Druidic
      Focus</emphasis></emphasis>. A druidic focus might be a sprig of
      mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another
      special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem
      object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred
      animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Fishing
      Tackle</emphasis></emphasis>. This kit includes a wooden rod,
      silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet
      lures, and narrow netting. Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather
      pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten
      uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize
      a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom
      (Medicine) check.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Holy
      Symbol</emphasis></emphasis>. A holy symbol is a representation of
      a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol
      representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid
      as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a
      sacred relic. Appendix PH-B <quote>Fantasy-Historical
      Pantheons</quote> lists the symbols commonly associated with many
      gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol
      as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster
      must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Holy
      Water</emphasis></emphasis>. As an action, you can splash the
      contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or
      throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case,
      make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy
      water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead,
      it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy
      water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to
      perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the
      caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Hunting
      Trap</emphasis></emphasis>. When you use your action to set it,
      this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a
      creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is
      affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or
      a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate
      must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4
      piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature
      breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of
      the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action
      to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature
      within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing
      damage to the trapped creature.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Lamp</emphasis></emphasis>. A
      lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an
      additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1
      pint) of oil. Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright
      light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.
      Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.
      Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot
      radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns
      for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can
      lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot
      radius.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Lock</emphasis></emphasis>. A
      key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature
      proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a
      successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better
      locks are available for higher prices.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Magnifying
      Glass</emphasis></emphasis>. This lens allows a closer look at
      small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and
      steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass
      requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite,
      and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass
      grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect
      an item that is small or highly detailed.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Manacles</emphasis></emphasis>.
      These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature.
      Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.
      Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set
      of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature
      proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a
      successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Mess Kit</emphasis></emphasis>.
      This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps
      together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other
      as a plate or shallow bowl.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Oil</emphasis></emphasis>. Oil
      usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you
      can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of
      you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a
      ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the
      oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in
      oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries
      (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage
      from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the
      ground to cover a 5-foot square area, provided that the surface is
      level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage
      to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area.
      A creature can take this damage only once per turn.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Poison,
      Basic</emphasis></emphasis>. You can use the poison in this vial
      to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of
      ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by
      the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution
      saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison
      retains potency for 1 minute before drying.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Potion of
      Healing</emphasis></emphasis>. A character who drinks the magical
      red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or
      administering a potion takes an action.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Pouch</emphasis></emphasis>. A
      cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50
      blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for
      holding spell components is called a component pouch (described
      earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20
      arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down
      doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check.
      One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage
      on this check.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Rations</emphasis></emphasis>.
      Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel,
      including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Rope</emphasis></emphasis>.
      Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be
      burst with a DC 17 Strength check.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Scale,
      Merchant’s</emphasis></emphasis>. A scale includes a small
      balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2
      pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small
      objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help
      determine their worth.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Spellbook</emphasis></emphasis>.
      Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with
      100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Spyglass</emphasis></emphasis>.
      Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their
      size.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Tent</emphasis></emphasis>. A
      simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Tinderbox</emphasis></emphasis>.
      This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually
      dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to
      light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes
      an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Torch</emphasis></emphasis>. A
      torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius
      and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee
      attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Equipment Packs</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      The starting equipment you get from your class includes a
      collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The
      contents of these packs are listed here. If you are buying your
      starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the price shown,
      which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Burglar’s Pack (16
      gp)</emphasis></emphasis>. Includes a backpack, a bag of 1,000
      ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a
      hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days
      rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet
      of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.
    </para>

    <title>Tools</title>
    <para>
      A tool helps you to do something you couldn’t otherwise do, such
      as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your
      race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with
      certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your
      proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool.
      Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a
      tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM
      might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail
      with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to make
      something out of particularly hard wood.

    <title>Mounts and Vehicles</title>
    <para>
      A good mount can help you move more quickly through the
      wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that
      would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table
      shows each animal’s speed and base carrying capacity.
    </para>
    <para>
      An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can
      move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including
      the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same
      vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.
    </para>
    <para>
      Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy
      gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for
      purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons,
      hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant
      sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means
      securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a
      bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount
      itself.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Barding</emphasis></emphasis>.
      Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck,
      chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be
      purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor
      made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Saddles</emphasis></emphasis>. A
      military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an
      active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you
      make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding
      any aquatic or flying mount.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Vehicle
      Proficiency</emphasis></emphasis>. If you have proficiency with a
      certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your
      proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of
      vehicle in difficult circumstances.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Rowed
      Vessels</emphasis></emphasis>. Keelboats and rowboats are used on
      lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the
      current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle.
      These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but
      they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A
      rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.

      Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain,
      land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a
      mine or a forest).
    </para>
    <para>
      Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies
      are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send
      merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods.
      Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and
      determine who may or may not offer those goods and services.
      Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency.
      The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.

    <para>
      When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins
      for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching
      darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a
      fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as
      shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money,
      although some lifestyles cost more than others.
    </para>

      <title>Lifestyle Expenses</title>
      <para>
        Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for
        the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your
        accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities.
        Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your
        equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.
      </para>
      <para>
        At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a
        lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain
        that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to
        calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day
        period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might
        change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have
        at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle
        throughout your character’s career.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a
        wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and
        powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves.
        Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but
        you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Wretched</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you
        shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old
        crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than
        you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence,
        disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched
        people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which
        represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the
        notice of most people.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Squalid</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town,
        or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town.
        You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate
        and often violent environment, in places rife with disease,
        hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most
        people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this
        lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might
        be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Poor</emphasis></emphasis>. A
        poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a
        stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing,
        and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though
        probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a
        room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You
        benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to
        contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this
        lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers,
        peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Modest</emphasis></emphasis>.
        A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that
        you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of
        town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You
        don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are
        clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles
        include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests,
        hedge wizards, and the like.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Comfortable</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer
        clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a
        small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private
        room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled
        tradespeople, and military officers.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Wealthy</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury,
        though you might not have achieved the social status associated
        with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle
        comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored
        servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses.
        You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good
        part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely
        have a small staff of servants.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Aristocratic</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles
        populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have
        excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of
        town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best
        restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and
        have servants attending to your every need. You receive
        invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful,
        and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders,
        high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the
        highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are,
        the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue
        as a pawn or participant.

          The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are
          spending your time between adventures in town, availing
          yourself of whatever services you can afford-paying for food
          and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and
          repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might
          prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining
          themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing
          their own gear.

          Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to

        Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act
        on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such
        hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters
        of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized
        adventuring skills.
      </para>
      <para>
        Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services
        table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of
        people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers
        pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might
        pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its
        miniature replica) for use in the <emphasis>secret
        chest</emphasis> spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith
        to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make
        exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the
        duke.
      </para>
      <para>
        Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services.
        Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a
        hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research
        ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes
        a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of
        servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or
        steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These
        hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place
        to live within the stronghold as part of the offered
        compensation.
      </para>
      <para>
        Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that
        involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a
        mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a
        minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained
        hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular
        skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar
        workers.

      <para>
        People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category
        of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone
        willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it
        is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule,
        the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to
        find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.
      </para>
      <para>
        Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd
        level, such as <emphasis>cure wounds</emphasis> or
        <emphasis>identify</emphasis>, is easy enough in a city or town,
        and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any
        expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing
        to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large
        city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once
        found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of
        payment-the kind of service that only adventurers can provide,
        such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or
        traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something
        important to a distant settlement.

      Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and

    </para>
    <para>
      The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving
      throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The
      book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls:
      roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six
      ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="ability-scores-and-modifiers">
      <title>Ability Scores and Modifiers</title>
      <para>
        Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that
        defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not
        just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a
        creature’s training and competence in activities related to that
        ability.
      </para>
      <para>
        A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers
        and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A
        score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches.
        Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and
        divine beings can have scores as high as 30.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and
        ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score
        of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability
        modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to
        30.

        To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table,

      </para>
      <para>
        Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll,
        ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in

  <section xml:id="advantage-and-disadvantage">
    <title>Advantage and Disadvantage</title>
    <para>
      Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have
      advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or
      an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you
      make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have
      advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For
      example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use
      the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you
      use the 17.
    </para>
    <para>
      If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage
      or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one
      additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for
      example, you still roll only one additional d20.
    </para>
    <para>
      If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and
      disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you
      roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose
      disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such
      a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.
    </para>
    <para>
      When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game,
      such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the
      d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose
      which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or
      disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the
      halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.
    </para>
    <para>
      You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of
      special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a
      character advantage. The
    </para>
    <para>
      GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one
      direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage
      as a result.

  <section xml:id="proficiency-bonus-1">
    <title>Proficiency Bonus</title>
    <para>
      Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters
      also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks.
      The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws,
      and attack rolls.
    </para>
    <para>
      Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or
      other number more than once. For example, if two different rules
      say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw,
      you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.
    </para>
    <para>
      Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or
      divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For
      example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency
      bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that
      your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll,
      you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.
    </para>
    <para>
      By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply
      your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t
      normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add
      the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is
      0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For
      instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain
      no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency
      bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.
    </para>
    <para>
      In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack
      rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do
      so, these same rules apply.

    <title>Ability Checks</title>
    <para>
      An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent
      and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls
      for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an
      action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When
      the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.
    </para>
    <para>
      For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities
      is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task,
      represented by a Difficulty Class.
    </para>
    <para>
      The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical
      Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

      To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability
      modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties,
      and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds
      the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the
      challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the
      character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or
      makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.

    <section xml:id="contests">
      <title>Contests</title>
      <para>
        Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly
        opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are
        trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as
        attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the
        floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to
        prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal- for example,
        when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is
        holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is
        determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.
      </para>
      <para>
        Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate
        to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and
        penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they
        compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the
        higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster
        either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from
        succeeding.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same
        as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the
        contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch
        a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest
        between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying
        to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

      <para>
        Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including
        skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A
        skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an
        individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that
        aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are
        determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill
        proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s
        attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to
        stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an
        associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth,
        respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth
        skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to
        sneaking and hiding.

        The skills related to each ability score are shown in the

        Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a
        specific skill-for example, <quote>Make a Wisdom (Perception)
        check.</quote> At other times, a player might ask the GM if
        proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either
        case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or
        her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill.
        Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal
        ability check.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous
        cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the
        character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s
        proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the
        character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a
        Strength check.
      </para>
      <section xml:id="variant-skills-with-different-abilities">
        <title>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</title>
        <para>
          Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a
          specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for
          example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some
          situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to
          a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for
          a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or
          you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a
          different check. For example, if you have to swim from an
          offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a
          Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it
          that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your
          proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution
          (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you
          apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as
          you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check.
          Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw
          strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a
          Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is
          normally associated with Charisma.

      </section>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="passive-checks">
      <title>Passive Checks</title>
      <para>
        A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t
        involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average
        result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret
        doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to
        secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something
        without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.
      </para>
      <para>
        Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:
      </para>
      <para>
        10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check
      </para>
      <para>
        If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For
        disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check
        total as a <emphasis role="strong">score</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and
        proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom
        (Perception) score of 14.
      </para>
      <para>
        The rules on hiding in the <quote>Dexterity</quote> section
        below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="working-together">
      <title>Working Together</title>
      <para>
        Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The
        character who’s leading the effort-or the one with the highest
        ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage,
        reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat,
        this requires the Help action.
      </para>
      <para>
        A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or
        she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock
        requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who
        lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that
        task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more
        individuals working together would actually be productive. Some
        tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.
      </para>
      <section xml:id="group-checks">
        <title>Group Checks</title>
        <para>
          When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish
          something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability
          check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at
          a particular task help cover those who aren’t.
        </para>
        <para>
          To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the
          ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole
          group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.
        </para>
        <para>
          Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful
          when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For
          example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might
          call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the
          characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other
          natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group
          succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their
          companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into
          one of these hazards.

            <para>
              The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for
              hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth)
              check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that
              check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception)
              check of any creature that actively searches for signs of
              your presence.

              You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly,

              An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its

            <para>
              In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger
              all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a
              creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain
              circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as
              you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you
              to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

              searching. To determine whether such a creature notices
              you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with
              that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which
              equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any
              other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage,
              add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a
              1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a
              Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in

            A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or

            a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social
            situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and

            Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can
            convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your
            actions. This deception can encompass everything from
            misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright
            lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a
            guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass
            yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with
            false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling

            trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing
            street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the

            use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster
            friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper
            etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing

    <title>Saving Throws</title>
    <para>
      A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist
      a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You
      don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to
      make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.
    </para>
    <para>
      To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability
      modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a
      Dexterity saving throw.
    </para>
    <para>
      A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty
      and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined
      by the GM.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The
      wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with
      skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a
      character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made
      using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw
      proficiencies as well.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the
      effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw
      allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting
      ability and proficiency bonus.
    </para>
    <para>
      The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed
      in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save
      means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an
      effect.

    <title>Time</title>
    <para>
      In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is
      important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM
      might use a different time scale depending on the context of the
      situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’
      movement happens on a scale of
      <emphasis role="strong">minutes</emphasis>. It takes them about a
      minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for
      traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes
      to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.
    </para>
    <para>
      In a city or wilderness, a scale of
      <emphasis role="strong">hours</emphasis> is often more
      appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the
      heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under
      four hours’ time.
    </para>
    <para>
      For long journeys, a scale of
      <emphasis role="strong">days</emphasis> works best.
    </para>
    <para>
      Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the
      adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush
      interrupts their journey.
    </para>
    <para>
      In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on
      <emphasis role="strong">rounds</emphasis>, a 6-second span of
      time.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="movement">
    <title>Movement</title>
    <para>
      Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor,
      scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a
      key role in fantasy gaming adventures.
    </para>
    <para>
      The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating
      exact distances or travel times: <quote>You travel through the
      forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the
      third day.</quote> Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon
      or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between
      encounters: <quote>After killing the guardian at the entrance to
      the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads
      you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a
      narrow stone arch.</quote>
    </para>
    <para>
      Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get
      from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or
      minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two
      factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the
      terrain they’re moving over.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="speed-1">
      <title>Speed</title>
      <para>
        Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance
        in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This
        number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst
        of a life-threatening situation.
      </para>
      <para>
        The following rules determine how far a character or monster can

      <section xml:id="travel-pace">
        <title>Travel Pace</title>
        <para>
          While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal,
          fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The
          table states how far the party can move in a period of time
          and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes
          characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it
          possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.
        </para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Forced
          March</emphasis></emphasis>. The Travel Pace table assumes
          that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on
          beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.
        </para>
        <para>
          For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the
          characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for
          their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving
          throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour
          past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers
          one level of exhaustion (see appendix ##).
        </para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Mounts and
          Vehicles</emphasis></emphasis>. For short spans of time (up to
          an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A
          mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour,
          covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh
          mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover
          larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in
          densely populated areas.
        </para>
        <para>
          Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose
          a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are
          limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer
          penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace.
          Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might
          be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

          The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume
          relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear
          dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests,
          deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and
          ice-covered ground-all considered difficult terrain.
        </para>
        <para>
          You move at half speed in difficult terrain- moving 1 foot in

      <title>Special Types of Movement</title>
      <para>
        Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often

          While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1
          extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a
          creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option,
          climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds
          requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly,

        <para>
          This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter,
          such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option,
          you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to
          clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s
          distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

          before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can
          jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear
          on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances,

        <para>
          You can extend your arms half your height above yourself

        A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards
        facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6
        bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of
        20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage

      <para>
        When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive
        for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier

        obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

        A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a

        A <emphasis role="strong">heavily obscured</emphasis> area-such

        area.

          A character can go without food for a number of days equal to

    <section xml:id="interacting-with-objects">
      <title>Interacting with Objects</title>
      <para>
        A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is
        often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM
        that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a
        lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which
        might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with
        water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is
        rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it.
        In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to
        see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The
        GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the
        task.
      </para>
      <para>
        Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and
        spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but
        otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks
        much like creatures can. The GM determines an object’s Armor
        Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have
        resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard
        to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail
        Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to
        effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit
        points, it breaks.
      </para>
      <para>
        A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an
        object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.

      Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of

      refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace
      themselves for further adventure.

      <title>Short Rest</title>
      <para>
        A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long,
        during which a character does nothing more strenuous than
        eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.
      </para>
      <para>
        A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short
        rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is
        equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this
        way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s
        Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points
        equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to
        spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains
        some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained
        below.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="long-rest">
      <title>Long Rest</title>
      <para>
        A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours
        long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and
        performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as
        reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is
        interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of
        walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring
        activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any
        benefit from it.
      </para>
      <para>
        At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit
        points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a
        number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of
        them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight
        Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon
        finishing a long rest.
      </para>
      <para>
        A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a

    <para>
      Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils,
      adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their

      other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research,
      or spending their hard-earned gold.
    </para>
    <para>
      In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with
      little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the
      GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed
      and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has
      been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of
      just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception

        Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your

      <title>Downtime Activities</title>
      <para>
        Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is
        doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary
        in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain
        number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at
        least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity
        for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If
        you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can
        keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch
        to a new downtime activity.
      </para>
      <para>
        Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are
        possible. If you want your character to spend his or her

        <para>
          You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring
          equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools
          related to the object you are trying to create (typically
          artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special
          materials or locations necessary to create it. For example,
          someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order
          to craft a sword or suit of armor.
        </para>
        <para>
          For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft
          one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5
          gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total
          market value. If something you want to craft has a market
          value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5 gp
          increments until you reach the market value of the item. For
          example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes
          300 days to craft by yourself.
        </para>
        <para>
          Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the
          crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all
          have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working
          together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp
          worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item.
          For example, three characters with the requisite tool
          proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of
          plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.

        <title>Researching</title>
        <para>
          The time between adventures is a great chance to perform
          research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled
          over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring
          over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying
          drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their
          lips.
        </para>
        <para>
          When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the
          information is available, how many days of downtime it will
          take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on
          your research (such as needing to seek out a specific
          individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you
          to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence
          (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the
          information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to
          secure someone’s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn
          the information if it is available.

    <title>Combat</title>
    <para>
      A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry
      of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The
      game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and
      turns. A <emphasis role="strong">round</emphasis> represents about
      6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a
      battle takes a <emphasis role="strong">turn</emphasis>. The order
      of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter,
      when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn,
      the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated
      the other.

      <title>Surprise</title>
      <para>
        A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from
        the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a
        dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube
        engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle
        gains surprise over the other.
      </para>
      <para>
        The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries
        to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise,
        the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding
        with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on
        the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice
        a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your
        first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until
        that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the
        other members aren’t.

    <section xml:id="initiative-1">
      <title>Initiative</title>
      <para>
        Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When
        combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to
        determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one
        roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member
        of the group acts at the same time.
      </para>
      <para>
        The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the
        highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This
        is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act
        during each round. The initiative order remains the same from
        round to round.
      </para>
      <para>
        If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied
        GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among
        their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is
        between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can
        have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to
        determine the order, highest roll going first.

      <para>
        The most common actions you can take are described in the

      <title>Bonus Actions</title>
      <para>
        Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take
        an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The
        Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a
        bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special
        ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can
        do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus
        action to take.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must
        choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one
        available.
      </para>
      <para>
        You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless
        the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that
        deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you
        from taking a bonus action.

      <title>Other Activity on Your Turn</title>

        neither your action nor your move.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can communicate however you are able, through brief
        utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can also interact with one object or feature of the
        environment for free, during either your move or your action.
        For example, you could open a door during your move as you
        stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of
        the same action you use to attack.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use
        your action. Some magic items and other special objects always
        require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.
      </para>
      <para>
        The GM might require you to use an action for any of these
        activities when it needs special care or when it presents an
        unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect
        you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to
        lower a drawbridge.

  <section xml:id="reactions">
    <title>Reactions</title>
    <para>
      Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to
      take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant
      response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn
      or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack, described later in
      this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.
    </para>
    <para>
      When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the
      start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another
      creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after
      the reaction.

  </section>
  <section xml:id="movement-and-position">
    <title>Movement and Position</title>
    <para>
      In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often
      using movement and position to gain the upper hand.
    </para>
    <para>
      On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can
      use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn,
      following the rules here.
    </para>
    <para>
      Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These
      different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they
      can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct
      the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is
      used up or until you are done moving.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="breaking-up-your-move">
      <title>Breaking Up Your Move</title>
      <para>
        You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your
        speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a
        speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and
        then move 20 feet.
      </para>
      <section xml:id="moving-between-attacks">
        <title>Moving between Attacks</title>
        <para>
          If you take an action that includes more than one weapon
          attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving
          between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two
          attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of
          25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and
          then attack again.

      </section>
      <section xml:id="using-different-speeds">
        <title>Using Different Speeds</title>
        <para>
          If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed
          and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your
          speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the
          distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result
          determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0
          or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.
        </para>
        <para>
          For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of
          60 because a wizard cast the <emphasis>fly</emphasis> spell on
          you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap

        Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless
        plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests,
        treacherous staircases-the setting of a typical fight contains
        difficult terrain.
      </para>
      <para>
        Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot.
        This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as

      </para>
      <para>
        Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and
        shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of
        another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as

      <para>
        Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either
        because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves
        down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in
        appendix A.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can <emphasis role="strong">drop prone</emphasis> without
        using any of your speed. <emphasis role="strong">Standing
        up</emphasis> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of
        movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is
        30 feet, you must spend
      </para>
      <para>
        15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t
        have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.
      </para>
      <para>
        To move while prone, you must
        <emphasis role="strong">crawl</emphasis> or use magic such as
        teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1
        extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore,

        You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast,
        you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the

        knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise

        <title>Space</title>
        <para>
          A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively
          controls in combat, not an expression of its physical
          dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for
          example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium
          hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot wide doorway, other creatures
          can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.
        </para>
        <para>
          A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight
          effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of
          creatures that can surround another creature in combat.
          Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a
          5-foot radius around another one.
        </para>
        <para>
          Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can
          surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a
          Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In
          contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a
          Gargantuan one.

          <para>
            A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough
            for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large
            creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet
            wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend
            1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has
            disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.
            Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s
            in the smaller space.

      special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters
      have action options of their own in their stat blocks.
    </para>
    <para>
      When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules,
      the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of
      roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="attack">
      <title>Attack</title>
      <para>
        The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action,

        brawling with your fists.
      </para>
      <para>
        With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the

      <para>

    <section xml:id="cast-a-spell">
      <title>Cast a Spell</title>
      <para>
        Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many
        monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect
        in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies
        whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or
        even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not
        necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1
        action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat
        to cast such a spell.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="dash">
      <title>Dash</title>
      <para>
        When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the
        current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any
        modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up
        to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.
      </para>
      <para>
        Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional
        movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced
        to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn
        if you dash.

      <title>Dodge</title>
      <para>
        When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding
        attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made
        against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and
        you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this
        benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or
        if your speed drops to 0.
      </para>

    <section xml:id="help">
      <title>Help</title>
      <para>
        You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a
        task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains
        advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task
        you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before
        the start of your next turn.
      </para>
      <para>
        Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a
        creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target,
        or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more
        effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next
        turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

    <section xml:id="hide">
      <title>Hide</title>
      <para>
        When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth)
        check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If
        you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the

      <title>Ready</title>
      <para>
        Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a
        particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take
        the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your
        reaction before the start of your next turn.
      </para>
      <para>
        First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger
        your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in
        response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed
        in response to it. Examples include <quote>If the cultist steps
        on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,</quote> and
        <quote>If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.</quote>
      </para>
      <para>
        When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right
        after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that
        you can take only one reaction per round.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its
        energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger
        occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1
        action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires
        concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell
        dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are
        concentrating on the <emphasis>web</emphasis> spell and ready
        <emphasis>magic missile</emphasis>, your
        <emphasis>web</emphasis> spell ends, and if you take damage
        before you release <emphasis>magic missile</emphasis> with your
        reaction, your concentration might be broken.

        When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to

        When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the

        modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the
        attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character

          you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or
          some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if
          you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you
          and who isn’t incapacitated.

      <title>Melee Attacks</title>
      <para>
        Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack
        a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a
        handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A
        typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its
        claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells
        also involve making a melee attack.
      </para>
      <para>
        Most creatures have a 5-foot
        <emphasis role="strong">reach</emphasis> and can thus attack
        targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack.
        Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have
        melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in
        their descriptions.
      </para>
      <para>
        Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can
        use an <emphasis role="strong">unarmed strike</emphasis>: a
        punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which
        count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning
        damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient
        with your unarmed strikes.

          Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of

        <para>
          In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to
          strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is
          called an opportunity attack.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature
          that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the
          opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee
          attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right
          before the creature leaves your reach.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the
          Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack
          when you teleport or when someone or something moves you
          without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example,
          you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls
          you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past
          an enemy.

      <title>Cover</title>
      <para>
        Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover
        during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target
        can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect
        originates on the opposite side of the cover.
      </para>
      <para>
        There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple
        sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover
        applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a
        target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree
        trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has
        three-quarters cover.

        A target with <emphasis role="strong">three-quarters

          Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental
          durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more
          hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit
          points are more fragile.
        </para>
        <para>
          A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit
          points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point
          maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a
          creature takes damage or receives healing.
        </para>
        <para>
          Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted

          For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll

          Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other

          bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25

        Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than
        deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0
        hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the

    <section xml:id="temporary-hit-points">
      <title>Temporary Hit Points</title>
      <para>
        Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to
        a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they
        are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect
        you from injury.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the
        temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage
        carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have
        5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary
        hit points and then take 2 damage.
      </para>
      <para>
        Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit
        points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can,
        therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit
        points.
      </para>
      <para>
        Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be
        added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive
        more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to
        gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12
        temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12
        or 10, not 22.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t
        restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still
        absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but
        only true healing can save you.
      </para>
      <para>
        Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a
        duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long

        Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5
        feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement
        equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet,
        you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore,
        you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or
        if your speed is 0.
      </para>
      <para>
        If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on
        it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall
        off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If
        you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same
        saving throw.
      </para>
      <para>
        If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to
        dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you

        control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent
        creatures, such as dragons, act independently.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a
        rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are
        assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled
        mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you
        direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash,
        Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even
        on the turn that you mount it.
      </para>
      <para>
        An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order.
        Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount
        can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from
        combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or
        otherwise act against your wishes.
      </para>

    <title>What Is a Spell?</title>
    <para>
      A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the
      magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific,
      limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully
      plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world,
      pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in
      a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired
      effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.
    </para>
    <para>
      Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They
      can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see
      appendix ##), drain life energy away, and restore life to the
      dead.
    </para>
    <para>
      Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of
      the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten.
      Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in
      ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might
      someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power
      and wisdom to do so.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="spell-level">
      <title>Spell Level</title>
      <para>
        Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a
        general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but
        still impressive) <emphasis>magic missile</emphasis> at 1st
        level and the earth-shaking <emphasis>wish</emphasis> at 9th.
        Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast
        almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the
        higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.
      </para>
      <para>
        Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly.
        Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th
        level, to cast a 9th-level spell.

    <section xml:id="known-and-prepared-spells">
      <title>Known and Prepared Spells</title>
      <para>
        Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the
        spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in
        a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and
        sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are
        always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using
        monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards,
        undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for
        different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.
      </para>
      <para>
        In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in
        mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.

      <title>Spell Slots</title>
      <para>
        Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or
        she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting.
        Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into
        even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and
        higher level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting
        class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a
        table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a
        character can use at each character level. For example, the
        3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two
        2nd-level slots.
      </para>
      <para>
        When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that
        spell’s level or higher, effectively <quote>filling</quote> a
        slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove
        of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell
        of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size,
        but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when
        Umara casts <emphasis>magic missile</emphasis>, a 1st-level
        spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three
        remaining.
      </para>
      <para>
        Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.
      </para>
      <para>
        Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let
        them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk
        who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses
        certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine
        Hells can all cast spells in such a way.

        <para>
          When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a
          higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher
          level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts
          <emphasis>magic missile</emphasis> using one of her 2nd-level
          slots, that <emphasis>magic missile</emphasis> is 2nd level.

      Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be

      be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10

      higher level.

      To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature

          fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response
          to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell
          description tells you exactly when you can do so.

        <title>Longer Casting Times</title>
        <para>
          Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more
          time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell
          with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction,
          you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and
          you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see
          <quote>Concentration</quote> below). If your concentration is
          broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If
          you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.

    <section xml:id="spell-range">
      <title>Spell Range</title>
      <para>
        The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a
        spell like <emphasis>magic missile</emphasis>, the target is a
        creature. For a spell like <emphasis>fireball</emphasis>, the
        target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.
      </para>
      <para>
        Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can
        target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other
        spells, such as the <emphasis>shield</emphasis> spell, affect
        only you. These spells have a range of self.
      </para>
      <para>
        Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from
        you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point
        of the spell’s effect must be you (see <quote>Areas of
        Effect</quote> later in the this chapter).
      </para>

        Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range,
        unless the spell’s description says otherwise.

      <title>Components</title>
      <para>
        A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet
        in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether
        it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components.
        If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you
        are unable to cast the spell.

      <section xml:id="verbal-v">
        <title>Verbal (V)</title>
        <para>
          Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words
          themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the
          particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and
          resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a
          character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one
          created by the <emphasis>silence</emphasis> spell, can’t cast
          a spell with a verbal component.

      <section xml:id="somatic-s">
        <title>Somatic (S)</title>
        <para>
          Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation
          or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic
          component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand
          to perform these gestures.

      </section>
      <section xml:id="material-m">
        <title>Material (M)</title>
        <para>
          Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in
          parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a
          <emphasis role="strong">component pouch</emphasis> or a
          <emphasis role="strong">spellcasting focus</emphasis> (found
          in <quote>Equipment</quote>) in place of the components
          specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a
          component, a character must have that specific component
          before he or she can cast the spell.
        </para>
        <para>
          If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the
          spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting
          of the spell.
        </para>
        <para>
          A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s
          material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can
          be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic
          components.

    <section xml:id="duration">
      <title>Duration</title>
      <para>
        A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A
        duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even
        years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the
        spells are dispelled or destroyed.

      <section xml:id="instantaneous">
        <title>Instantaneous</title>
        <para>
          Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals,
          creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t
          be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

        <title>Concentration</title>
        <para>
          Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to
          keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a
          spell ends.
        </para>
        <para>
          If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact
          appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how
          long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at
          any time (no action required).
        </para>
        <para>
          Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t

          The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena,

      <title>Targets</title>
      <para>
        A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be
        affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you
        whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of
        origin for an area of effect (described below).
      </para>
      <para>
        Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not
        know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling
        lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an
        attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed,
        unless a spell says otherwise.

        <title>A Clear Path to the Target</title>

          can’t be behind total cover.

        <para>
          If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see
          and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that
          point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side
          of that obstruction.

          If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose
          yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically
          a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of
          a spell you cast, you can target yourself.

      <para>
        Spells such as <emphasis>burning hands</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>cone of cold</emphasis> cover an area, allowing them
        to affect multiple creatures at once.
      </para>
      <para>
        A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which
        typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube,
        cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a
        <emphasis role="strong">point of origin</emphasis>, a location
        from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape
        specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point
        of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area
        whose origin is a creature or an object.
      </para>
      <para>
        A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of
        origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of
        origin to a location within the area of effect, that location
        isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these
        imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

          A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of
          origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is
          equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A
          cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

          length of each side.

        <para>
          A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a
          particular radius, as given in the spell description. The
          circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the
          spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight
          lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle,
          forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then
          shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance
          equal to the height of the cylinder.

      Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid

      that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or
      failure.

      Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine

      Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks.

      The effects of different spells add together while the durations

        A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range
        and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack
        against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage
        immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On
        a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much
        of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

        You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a

        or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you

        the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or

        You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one

        different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if
        you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal,
        for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can

        By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message.
        Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a
        squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which
        you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general
        description, such as <quote>a man or woman dressed in the
        uniform of the town guard</quote> or <quote>a red-haired dwarf
        wearing a pointed hat.</quote> You also speak a message of up to
        twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of
        the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles
        per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other
        animals.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the
        creature that you described, replicating the sound of your
        voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the
        description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its
        destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the
        beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.

        Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of
        willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform
        each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a
        challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use
        your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.
      </para>
      <para>
        The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or
        until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a
        different form for each target. A target’s game statistics are
        replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the
        target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and
        Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new
        form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the
        number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts
        as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
        carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage
        doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it
        isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the
        actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it
        can’t speak or cast spells.
      </para>
      <para>
        The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t
        activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

        This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or
        a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell
        imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an
        undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose
        bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the
        creature’s game statistics).

        On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally
        command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is
        within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you
        can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the
        same command to each one). You decide what action the creature
        will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you
        can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular
        chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only
        defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order,
        the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

      <para>
        The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it

        of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell
        on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends.
        This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four
        creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than
        animating a new one.

        Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten

        count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You
        can’t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates

      <para>
        An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks,
        Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution
        is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is
        1. Its speed is
      </para>
      <para>
        30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use
        for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can
        hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a
        larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0.
        It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond
        that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points,
        it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage
        carries over to its original object form.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee
        attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam
        attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by
        its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts
        slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

        A 10-foot radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you.
        This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the
        multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned
        creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until
        the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.
      </para>
      <para>
        Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an
        artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t
        protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is
        consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function,
        but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

        extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic,
        the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is
        suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <emphasis>wall
        of fire</emphasis> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a
        gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.
      </para>

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Spells</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an

        longsword</emphasis> in the sphere functions as a nonmagical
        longsword.
      </para>
      <para>
        A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is
        used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in
        the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition
        fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow
        or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the
        magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

        Travel</emphasis></emphasis>. Teleportation and planar travel
        fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the

        portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as
        well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that

        This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You
        target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object
        or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube.
        Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red
        dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an
        aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for
        the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Antipathy</emphasis></emphasis>.
        The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to
        feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target.
        When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet
        of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
        become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can
        see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by
        the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the
        nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the
        creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can’t see
        it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature
        becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or
        moves within 60 feet of it.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Sympathy</emphasis></emphasis>.
        The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an
        intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it
        or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or
        comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a
        Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to
        enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the
        creature has done so, it can’t willingly move away from the
        target.

      <para>
        If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature,
        the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the

        turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it,
        the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save,
        the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes
        the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition,
        a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom
        saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.

        You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an

        for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command,
        mimicking the movements of your own hand.
      </para>
      <para>
        The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to
        your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell
        ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0).
        The hand doesn’t fill its space.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent
        turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of

        Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength
        (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or

        hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal
        to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves

        or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is
        grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the

        You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your
        astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the
        casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The
        material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of
        suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t
        age.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way,
        replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal
        difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from
        between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to
        invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your
        material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can
        find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen
        only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul
        and body are separated, killing you instantly.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and
        can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If
        you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when
        casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported
        along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you
        enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation.
        Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on
        your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
      </para>
      <para>
        The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your
        action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature
        returns to its physical body, and it awakens.

      <para>
        The spell might also end early for you or one of your
        companions. A successful <emphasis>dispel magic</emphasis> spell
        used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that
        creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops
        to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell
        ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the
        creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of
        suspended animation.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions

        You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made
        of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for
        the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long,
        20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet
        in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides
        three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is
        difficult terrain.

        When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a
        turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a
        Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
        6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes
        half as much damage.

        Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of
        the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your
        current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the
        spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on
        that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell
        ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an
        unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet
        of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is
        available within that range, you appear in the nearest
        unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is
        equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

        A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet
        tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see

        You create an invisible sensor within range in a location
        familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in
        an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a

        This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a

        and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also
        choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same

        Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has
        a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast
        that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting
        <emphasis>contingency</emphasis>, expending spell slots for
        both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect.
        Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You
        describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For
        example, a <emphasis>contingency</emphasis> cast with
        <emphasis>water breathing</emphasis> might stipulate that
        <emphasis>water breathing</emphasis> comes into effect when you
        are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
      </para>
      <para>
        The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the
        circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want
        it to, and then <emphasis>contingency</emphasis> ends.
      </para>
      <para>
        The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can
        normally target others. You can use only one
        <emphasis>contingency</emphasis> spell at a time. If you cast
        this spell again, the effect of another
        <emphasis>contingency</emphasis> spell on you ends. Also,
        <emphasis>contingency</emphasis> ends on you if its material
        component is ever not on your person.

      <para>
        Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside
        an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You
        can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this
        spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect
        or choose a different one.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Flood</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to
        rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the
        flooding water spills over onto dry land.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead
        create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the
        area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller
        vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other
        side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25
        percent chance of capsizing.
      </para>
      <para>
        The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you
        choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the
        wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood
        effect lasts.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Part
        Water</emphasis></emphasis>. You cause water in the area to move
        apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s
        area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The
        trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different
        effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the
        course of the next round until the normal water level is
        restored.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Redirect
        Flow</emphasis></emphasis>. You cause flowing water in the area
        to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow
        over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The
        water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves
        beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the
        terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction
        you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Whirlpool</emphasis></emphasis>.
        This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and
        25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the
        area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the
        base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any
        creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex
        is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the
        vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell
        save DC.
      </para>
      <para>
        When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn
        or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw.
        On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and
        is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful
        save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the
        vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to
        try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has
        disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.
      </para>
      <para>
        The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the
        object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each
        round it remains in the vortex.

        You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three
        corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse
        becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics

        As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally
        command any creature you animated with this spell if the
        creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple
        creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time,
        issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action
        the creature will take and where it will move during its next
        turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a
        particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the
        creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once
        given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its
        task is complete.
      </para>
      <para>
        The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it
        stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control
        of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell
        on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use
        of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures
        you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new
        ones.

        A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then
        condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing
        bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your

        bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that
        spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere
        centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A

        You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can

        creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door
        leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in
        each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the
        door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the

      <para>
        For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain
        creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each
        turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one
        creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature
        you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak
        any language, the creature is unaffected.
      </para>
      <para>
        You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is
        most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either
        shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt
        to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe
        deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails,
        you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional
        state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as
        something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the
        spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing
        into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another
        creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn
        to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence
        check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.
      </para>
      <para>
        Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally
        shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly
        effective as part of an interrogation.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking
        creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your
        action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within
        30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of
        rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of
        lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an
        Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any
        language.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can
        read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described
        above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within
        range.

        You make yourself-including your clothing, armor, weapons, and
        other belongings on your person- look different until the spell
        ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1
        foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between.
        You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that
        has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent
        of the illusion is up to you.

        The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical
        inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to
        your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who
        touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair.
        If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand
        of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you
        while it was seemingly still in midair.
      </para>
      <para>
        To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action

        You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It
        must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for
        the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are
        fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
      </para>
      <para>
        While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it
        as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
        You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the
        creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it
        does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general
        course of action, such as <quote>Attack that creature,</quote>
        <quote>Run over there,</quote> or <quote>Fetch that
        object.</quote> If the creature completes the order and doesn’t
        receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves
        itself to the best of its ability.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use your action to take total and precise control of the
        target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only
        the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t
        allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the
        creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your
        own reaction as well.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving

        You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range.
        It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you
        for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you
        are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

      <para>
        While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with
        it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
        You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the
        creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it
        does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general
        course of action, such as <quote>Attack that creature,</quote>
        <quote>Run over there,</quote> or <quote>Fetch that
        object.</quote> If the creature completes the order and doesn’t

        You can use your action to take total and precise control of the

        This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature known
        to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the
        same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such
        as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing
        creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a
        messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or
        her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s
        dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains
        asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can
        also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes,
        objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the
        trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The
        target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is
        awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can
        either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to
        fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the
        target’s dreams.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to
        the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no
        more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom
        saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal
        monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the
        target’s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit
        from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes
        3d6 psychic damage.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or
        similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes its
        saving throw with disadvantage.

        You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that
        you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor
        rips through the ground in a 100-foot radius circle centered on
        that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with
        the ground in that area.

        When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Fissures</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your
        next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures
        open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep,
        10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to
        the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure
        opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A
        creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge
        as it opens.
      </para>
      <para>
        A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to
        automatically collapse (see below).
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Structures</emphasis></emphasis>.
        The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in
        contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and
        at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a
        structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially
        damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of
        a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
        failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is
        knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20
        Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can
        adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the
        rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
        damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.

        You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to
        grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a
        creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the
        target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On
        a success, the spell has no effect.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and
        carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected
        creature returns to normal size at once.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Enlarge</emphasis></emphasis>.
        The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is
        multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one
        category- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t
        enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or
        object attains the maximum possible size in the space available.
        Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength
        checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also
        grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged,
        the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Reduce</emphasis></emphasis>.
        The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is
        reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its
        size by one category-from Medium to Small, for example. Until
        the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength
        checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also
        shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced,
        the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t
        reduce the damage below 1).

        You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of
        your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you
        to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can’t be
        charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you
        or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on
        the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on
        Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other
        than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer
        hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no
        longer speak.

        You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the
        area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in
        the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your
        action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in
        any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement

        quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone,
        or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can
        be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot

        Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue,

        You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an

        lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat,
        raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied
        space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the
        chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your
        choice) instead of a beast.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys
        your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts
        on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other
        actions as normal.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving
        behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell
        again.
      </para>
      <para>
        While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you  can
        communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action,
        you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears
        until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any
        special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are
        deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
      </para>
      <para>
        As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It
        disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons.
        Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it
        is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any
        unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast
        this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause
        it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above
        list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.
      </para>
      <para>
        Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your
        familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your
        familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its
        reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell
        requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the
        roll.

        chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your
        choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed
        has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6,
        and it gains the ability to understand one language of your
        choice that you speak.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and
        you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as
        a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any
        spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving
        behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any
        time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case,
        casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its
        hit point maximum.
      </para>
      <para>
        While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate
        with each other telepathically.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a
        time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at
        any time, causing it to disappear.

        This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet
        in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the
        ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see
        within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up

        terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t
        cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the

        You create a 20-foot radius sphere of fog centered on a point
        within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is
        heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of
        moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses

        You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to
        40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above
        the floor. For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the
        area or use portals, such as those created by the
        <emphasis>gate</emphasis> spell, to enter the area. The spell
        proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents
        creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane,
        Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the <emphasis>plane

        In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you

        celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen
        creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or
        starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or
        necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).

        An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical

        A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side,

        A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means.
        If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel
        to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw.
        On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage.
        On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the
        use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the
        Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

        A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a
        point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a
        60-foot radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a
        Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
        10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much
        damage.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is
        principally water (not including water-based creatures), it
        freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet
        square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were
        swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice.
        A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check
        against your spell save DC to break free.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the
        spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling
        stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you
        or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a
        range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal
        range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the
        normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down
        without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t
        already shattered, it explodes.

        You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see

        opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the

        of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and

      </para>
      <para>
        Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier
        can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell
        is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target
        creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no
        effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is
        excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

      <para>
        When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other
        creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section
        of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such
        as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph.
        The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter.
        If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where
        you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends
        without being triggered.
      </para>
      <para>
        The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful
        Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to
        be found.
      </para>
      <para>
        You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For
        glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include
        touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object
        covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the
        glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is
        inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most
        common triggers include opening that object, approaching within
        a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the
        glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only
        under certain circumstances or according to physical
        characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for
        example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow),
        or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that
        don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain
        password.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you inscribe the glyph, choose <emphasis>explosive
        runes</emphasis> or a <emphasis>spell glyph</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Explosive
        Runes</emphasis></emphasis>. When triggered, the glyph erupts
        with magical energy in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on the
        glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the
        area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8
        acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed
        saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as
        much damage on a successful one.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Spell
        Glyph</emphasis></emphasis>. You can store a prepared spell of
        3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of
        creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or
        an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when
        cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell
        is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that
        triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is
        centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile
        creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as
        close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell
        requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full
        duration.
      </para>

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>At Higher

        You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look,
        sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus,
        open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill,
        crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond
        can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a
        gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth
        road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within
        the area aren’t changed in appearance.

      <para>
        The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so
        creatures entering the area are likely to see through the
        illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature
        carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence
        (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve
        it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it
        as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

        You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see
        within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.
        On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much
        damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce the
        target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving
        throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount
        equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a
        disease allows a creature’s hit point maximum to return to
        normal before that time passes.

        Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to
        your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the
        thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales,
        forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been
        widely known. If the thing you named isn’t of legendary
        importance, you gain no information. The more information you

        One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see
        within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains
        suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a

        succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

        The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed

        the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on
        your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as
        part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move
        the target, which must remain within the spell’s range.

        Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the

        actions at all.

      <para>
        While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from
        the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you,
        returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body
        dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a
        Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a
        success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of
        you. Otherwise, you die.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul
        immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100
        feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to
        return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the
        container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to
        its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise,
        that creature dies.

        You implant a message within an object in range, a message that
        is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object
        that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another
        creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or
        less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes.
        Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell
        to deliver your message.
      </para>
      <para>
        When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the
        object and recites the message in your voice and at the same
        volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or
        something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a
        statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words
        appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this
        spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message,
        or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger
        occurs.
      </para>
      <para>
        The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as
        you like, though it must be based on visual or audible
        conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example,
        you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves
        within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within
        30 feet of it.

        You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for
        the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The
        entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall.
        You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can
        enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal
        remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within
        30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.
      </para>
      <para>
        Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers

        You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t
        exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place
        is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient
        food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A
        staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter.
        You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their
        attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each
        servant can perform any task a normal human servant could
        perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would
        directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch
        things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour
        wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but
        can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this
        spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the
        spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are
        expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

        You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other
        visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The
        image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts
        for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds,
        smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You
        can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound
        loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a
        smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).
      </para>
      <para>
        As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use
        your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within
        range. As the image changes location, you can alter its
        appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.
        For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it,
        you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
        Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds
        at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for
        example.
      </para>
      <para>
        Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
        illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that
        uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an
        illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check
        against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion
        for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its
        other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

        You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two)

        that you can see within range and that can hear and understand
        you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.
        The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the
        course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab
        itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some
        other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of
        the spell.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,

        You create a sound or an image of an object within range that

        as an action or cast this spell again.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a
        scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s
        roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The
        sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can
        make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you create an image of an object-such as a chair, muddy
        footprints, or a small chest-it must be no larger than a 5-foot
        cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other
        sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it
        to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

        If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the

        You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound,
        smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The
        terrain’s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields
        or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or
        some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made
        to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope,
        or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
      </para>
      <para>
        Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add
        them where none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise,
        conceal, or add creatures.
      </para>
      <para>
        The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory
        elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or
        vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any
        piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is
        removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately.
      </para>
      <para>
        Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the
        terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion
        remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s
        presence, the creature can still physically interact with the
        illusion.

        Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space.
        Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic
        your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track
        which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the
        illusory duplicates.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the

        instead targets one of your duplicates.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to
        change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates,
        you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll
        an 11 or higher.
      </para>
      <para>
        A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an

        You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature
        that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are
        fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On
        a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the
        duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its
        surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any
        damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and
        none of the target’s memories are modified.
      </para>
      <para>
        While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an
        event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that
        lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate
        all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event
        with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of
        the details of the event, or create a memory of some other
        event.
      </para>
      <para>
        You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are
        affected, and it must be able to understand your language for
        the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps
        in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you
        have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s
        memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold
        when the spell ends.
      </para>
      <para>
        A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature
        behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s
        natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical
        modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the
        creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps
        as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too
        nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

        time in the creature’s past (9th level).

        Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side

        flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes
        can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you
        affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet
        high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet,

        A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in
        an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the
        creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit,

        hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed
        gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The

        You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be
        known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other
        being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an
        elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the
        creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know
        a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name when you
        cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a
        different creature anyway (GM’s choice).
      </para>
      <para>
        When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave
        in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a
        service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so.
        The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the
        chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our
        enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You
        must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its
        services.
      </para>
      <para>
        Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a
        sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple,
        while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of
        treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a
        quest undertaken by you.
      </para>
      <para>
        As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes
        requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in
        hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days
        (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust
        these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast
        the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the
        payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks
        typically require only half the suggested payment, while
        especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift.
        Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.
      </para>
      <para>
        After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon
        duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home
        plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task
        and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the
        creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home
        plane.

        With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental,
        a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within
        range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the
        creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted
        <emphasis>magic circle</emphasis> in order to keep it trapped
        while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the
        target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it
        is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was
        summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is
        extended to match the duration of this spell.
      </para>
      <para>
        A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of
        its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on
        an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The
        creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the
        creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to
        achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your
        instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you
        to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence.
        If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the
        place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

        You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle

        specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City
        of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of
        Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear
        in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City
        of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel,
        before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the
        Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.

        Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation

        all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest
        unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

      <para>
        You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to
        another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a
        melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make
        a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is
        transported to a random location on the plane of existence you
        specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to
        your current plane of existence.

        This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range
        into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving
        throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a
        shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
      </para>
      <para>
        The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target
        drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast
        whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or
        the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The
        target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are
        replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its
        alignment and personality.
      </para>
      <para>
        The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it
        reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number
        of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a
        result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries
        over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t
        reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t
        knocked unconscious.
      </para>
      <para>
        The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the
        nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take
        any other action that requires hands or speech.
      </para>
      <para>
        The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t

        A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical
        opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch
        thick-centered on a point you can see within range.
        Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30
        feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range.
        The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the
        wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature,
        the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.
      </para>
      <para>
        The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim
        light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you
        designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and
        remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can
        see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn
        there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw
        or become blinded for 1 minute.
      </para>
      <para>
        The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color.
        When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall,
        it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As
        it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make
        a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s
        properties as described below.

        The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order

        You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other
        visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific
        condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It
        must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you
        cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it
        makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into
        existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the
        illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant
        for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated
        again.
      </para>
      <para>
        The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you
        like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions
        that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could
        create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who
        attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to
        trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

        Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
        illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that

        illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check

        You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your

        You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you
        were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can
        switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again.
        While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in
        regard to your own surroundings.

        creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine
        that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
        (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature
        discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
        through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the
        creature.

        The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types
        have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target
        also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the
        target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a
        creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw
        against the relevant effect.

        You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it

      <para>
        This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical
        diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This
        spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or
        similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting
        the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life.
        The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.

        This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore

        spell automatically fails.

        Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4

        pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the
        sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage,
        and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or
        effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the
        sphere damage anything outside it.

      <para>
        The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the
        creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its
        action to push against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the
        sphere at up to half the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe
        can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

      <para>
        This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases
        afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn’t, however,
        remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects
        aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the
        target on its return to life.

        Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4
        penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.
        Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is
        reduced by 1 until it disappears.

      <para>
        Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been
        dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish
        a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have
        disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving
        throws.

        You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end

        You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell

        make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is
        unaffected by this spell.
      </para>
      <para>
        The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing,
        armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1
        foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You
        can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form
        that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the
        extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the
        duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
      </para>
      <para>
        The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical
        inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a
        creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who
        touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head
        and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are,
        the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into
        you while it was seemingly still in midair.
      </para>
      <para>
        A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an
        Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
        If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

        You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a

        message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows
        you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell

        By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be
        hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast
        the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t
        be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying
        sensors created by divination spells.

        You assume the form of a different creature for the duration.
        The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating
        equal to your level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct
        or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at
        least once. You transform into an average example of that
        creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting
        trait.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the
        chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and
        Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all
        of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to
        gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same
        proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is
        higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours.
        You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new
        form.
      </para>
      <para>
        You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you
        revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit
        points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result
        of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
        your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce
        your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked
        unconscious.
      </para>
      <para>
        You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or
        other source and can use them, provided that your new form is
        physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses
        you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has
        that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally
        speak.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to
        the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn
        equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is
        practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based
        on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change
        shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the
        new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into
        your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that
        state.
      </para>
      <para>
        During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume
        a different form following the same restrictions and rules for
        the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more
        hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at
        their current value.

        You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other

        You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot

        Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot

        An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to

        both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it
        can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

        You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of

        Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five
        questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including
        the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or
        repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a
        truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as
        an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its
        body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn
        new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened
        since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.

      <para>
        You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two)
        and magically influence a creature you can see within range that
        can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are
        immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a
        manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking
        the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate
        itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
      </para>
      <para>
        The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it
        pursues the course of action you described to the best of its
        ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the
        entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a
        shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it
        was asked to do.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special
        activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest
        that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.
        If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the
        activity isn’t performed.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell
        ends.

        A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot

      <para>
        When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on
        a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or
        within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such
        as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a
        surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger
        than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object
        must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10
        feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and
        the spell ends without being triggered.
      </para>
      <para>
        The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence
        (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.
      </para>
      <para>
        You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For
        glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include
        touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object
        covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or
        manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed
        within an object, the most common triggers are opening the
        object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing
        or reading the glyph.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated
        only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s
        physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical
        kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or
        shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t
        trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for
        its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot
        radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time
        the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph
        activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that
        enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn
        there.

        Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Discord</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
        save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1
        minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful
        communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
        checks.

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Fear</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes
        frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the
        target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30
        feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Hopelessness</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save,
        the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this
        time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful
        abilities, spells, or other magical effects.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Insanity</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed
        save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane
        creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other
        creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM
        controls its movement, which is erratic.

        You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects
        by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each
        round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature
        or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate
        effect below. You can affect the same target round after round,
        or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the
        prior target is no longer affected by the spell.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Creature</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability
        check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature’s
        Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up
        to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the
        range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the
        creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature
        lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.
      </para>
      <para>
        On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to
        maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the
        contest.

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Object</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If
        the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move
        it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of
        this spell.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an
        ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that
        creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object
        away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any
        direction but not beyond the range of this spell.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic
        grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a

        or pouring the contents from a vial.

        single object that you can see within range, to a destination
        you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit

        <quote>Very familiar</quote> is a place you have been very

        random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of
        the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried
        to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on
        the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18
        miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by
        rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as
        east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were
        teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea,

        wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has
        many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory.
        Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since
        the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up

        wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

        As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the
        ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a
        permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil
        sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as
        you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and
        remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that
        enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the
        destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that
        space is occupied.
      </para>
      <para>
        Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have
        permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their
        confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence-a
        string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When
        you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the
        sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane,
        determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences
        during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to
        memory after studying it for 1 minute.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this
        spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not
        use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

        Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within

        creature into a nonmagical object, or the object into a creature

        The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it

        Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally

        servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending,
        folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine.

        An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you

        choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It
        can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form
        it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to
        10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten
        10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with
        another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts
        for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space

        If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the

        0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air
        in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the
        sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a

        A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a
        point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is
        composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be
        contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can
        create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the
        creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a
        creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the
        wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a
        Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to
        move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the
        wall.
      </para>
      <para>
        The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy
        the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to
        be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however,
        merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you
        can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must
        halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely
        shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.
      </para>
      <para>
        The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus
        breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of
        thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and
        might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole
        duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled.
        Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

        A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and

        This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid
        surface-such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava-as if

        You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your

        creature in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your

        save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The
        illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its
        worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of
        the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom
        saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save,
        the spell ends for that creature.

        You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range
        assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of
        cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed
        of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical
        weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are
        the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes
        1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and
        can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud
        form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.

        If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends,

        A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you
        choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long,
        15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any
        way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the
        ground. The wall lasts for the duration.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a

        on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
      </para>
      <para>
        The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small
        or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the
        wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly
        upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched
        at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and
        automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines,
        and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous
        form can’t pass through it.

        You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the

        such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the
        likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply
        fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or
        you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how
        you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were
        dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that
        villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the
        game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact
        might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s
        current owner.

        The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other
        than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that
        stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest,
        you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This
        damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition,
        your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for
        2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and
        doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery
        time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance
        that you are unable to cast <emphasis>wish</emphasis> ever again

      <para>
        If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that
        causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by
        the amount specified in the effect’s description.
      </para>
      <para>
        A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion
        as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering
        level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on
        ability checks.
      </para>
      <para>
        An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified
        in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending
        if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.
      </para>
      <para>
        Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by
        1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and
        drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature’s
        exhaustion level by 1.

      The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy
      interpretations of historical religions from our world’s ancient
      times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a
      game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and
      united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.

      <para>
        It’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul,
        a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to
        the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of
        mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods
        dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might
        heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the
        woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a
        name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice
        babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.
      </para>

        The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for
        they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids

      <para>
        The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of
        waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the
        cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the
        sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing.
        Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve
        made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.

      <title>The Egyptian Pantheon</title>
      <para>
        These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family,
        heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the
        divine principle of Ma’at-the fundamental order of truth,
        justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and
        ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in
        the universe.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods
        responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is
        the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of
        the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best
        known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic
        good goddess of mourning.

      <title>The Norse Pantheon</title>
      <para>
        Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords
        below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the
        glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and
        spring-this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse
        pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal
        living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh
        conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too
        twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity
        of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals
        turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need
        these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action.
        Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them
        in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and
        smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir
        (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility
        and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now
        closely allied against their common enemies, the giants
        (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).

    <para>
      The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad
      alternate dimensions of reality, called the
      <emphasis role="strong">planes of existence</emphasis>. It
      encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within
      the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that
      plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of
      pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the
      dominions of the gods.
    </para>
    <para>
      Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes,
      summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their
      denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character
      achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on
      streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield
      where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.

      <title>The Material Plane</title>
      <para>
        The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and
        elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the
        jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy
        gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the
        starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of
        the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.
      </para>
      <para>
        The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for
        they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their
        games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure
        there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and
        island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with
        advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age,
        worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.

        Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are
        realms of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but
        different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual
        and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.

        <para>
          When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they
          are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of
          existence to a mythic destination where they strive to
          complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend.
          Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial
          servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home
          city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.
        </para>
        <para>
          Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be
          accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a

          A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other
          planes of existence. <emphasis>Plane shift</emphasis> and
          <emphasis>gate</emphasis> can transport adventurers directly
          to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of
          precision. <emphasis>Etherealness</emphasis> allows
          adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there
          to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes.
          And the <emphasis>astral projection</emphasis> spell lets
          adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and
          travel to the Outer Planes.
        </para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Portals</emphasis></emphasis>.
          A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar
          connection that links a specific location on one plane to a
          specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways,
          a clear window, or a fog- shrouded passage, and simply
          stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are
          locations- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing
          ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at
          once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are
          vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very
          similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a
          volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the
          ocean (to the Plane of Water).

        <title>Transitive Planes</title>
        <para>
          The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the
          Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that
          serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another.
          Spells such as <emphasis>etherealness</emphasis> and
          <emphasis>astral projection</emphasis> allow characters to
          enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes
          beyond.
        </para>
        <para>
          The <emphasis role="strong">Ethereal Plane</emphasis> is a
          misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a
          great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap
          the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every
          location on those planes has a corresponding location on the
          Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border
          Ethereal, and the <emphasis>see invisibility</emphasis> and
          <emphasis>true seeing</emphasis> spell grant that ability.
          Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into
          the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force
          energy such as <emphasis>forcecage</emphasis> and
          <emphasis>wall of force</emphasis>. The depths of the plane,
          the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful
          fogs.
        </para>
        <para>
          The <emphasis role="strong">Astral Plane</emphasis> is the
          realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as
          disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and
          demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below,
          with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of
          light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color
          flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of
          solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane
          is an endless, open domain.

      <section xml:id="inner-planes">
        <title>Inner Planes</title>
        <para>
          The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and
          its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which
          all the worlds were made. The four
          <emphasis role="strong">Elemental Planes</emphasis> - Air,
          Earth, Fire, and Water - form a ring around the Material
          Plane, suspended within the churning
          <emphasis role="strong">Elemental Chaos</emphasis>.
        </para>
        <para>
          At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the
          Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical
          sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the
          Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do
          in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther
          from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both
          alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest
          form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire,
          crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are
          little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for
          example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At
          the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements
          dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of
          clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental
          Chaos.
        </para>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="outer-planes">
        <title>Outer Planes</title>
        <para>
          If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes
          up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought
          and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages
          refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes,
          or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the
          homes of deities.
        </para>
        <para>
          When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used
          must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not
          literally <quote>places</quote> at all, but exemplify the idea
          that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As
          with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible
          part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while
          extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory
          experience.
        </para>
        <para>
          Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be
          deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear
          hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But
          the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces
          that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty
          forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely,
          effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better
          fulfill their own needs.
        </para>
        <para>
          Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer
          Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite
          small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like
          infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the
          Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single
          day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take
          weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single
          layer.
        </para>
        <para>
          The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes
          that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality)
          and the shades of distinction between them.

            The planes with some element of good in their nature are
            called the <emphasis role="strong">Upper Planes</emphasis>.
            Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the
            Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the
            <emphasis role="strong">Lower Planes</emphasis>. Fiends such
            as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane’s
            alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment
            doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of
            dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for
            example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with
            the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more
            than a little uncomfortable.

          <para>
            Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own
            unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to
            fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety
            of means. Some are created by spells, such as
            <emphasis>demiplane</emphasis>, or generated at the desire
            of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist
            naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been
            pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby
            universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered
            through a single point where it touches another plane.
            Theoretically, a <emphasis>plane shift</emphasis> spell can
            also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper
            frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to
            acquire. The <emphasis>gate</emphasis> spell is more
            reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.

        Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient
        tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave
        through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang
        over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes
        through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on
        travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary
        adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall
        under a fusillade of poisoned darts.

        A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature.

        either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps

            Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a
            false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a
            doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are
            often set to go off when a creature enters an area or
            touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the
            <emphasis>glyph of warding</emphasis> spell) have more

            inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that
            conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a
            trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets
            of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that
            points to a trap’s presence.
          </para>
          <para>
            A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to
            detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking
            for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against
            the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the
            trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score
            to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in
            passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering
            it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or
            long enough to move past it. You might call for an
            Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce
            what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using
            thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.
          </para>
          <para>
            Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to
            detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other
            checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same
            regardless of the check used. In addition, <emphasis>dispel
            magic</emphasis> has a chance of disabling most magic traps.
            A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability
            check made when you use <emphasis>dispel magic</emphasis>.
          </para>
          <para>
            In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you
            can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil
            the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die
            rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your
            common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine
            what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible
            action that the characters might attempt.
          </para>
          <para>
            You should allow a character to discover a trap without
            making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal
            the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug
            that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the
            trigger and no check is required.
          </para>
          <para>
            Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a
            trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first
            pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism
            inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front
            of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks,
            the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than
            simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and
            push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this
            case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires
            harmlessly into the shield.
          </para>
          <para>
            Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to
            be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place
            traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those
            traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have
            hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door
            might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.

          <para>
            The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly,
            making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades,
            poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The
            deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure,
            contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to
            trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens

            The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its
            effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the
            trap’s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses

            Complex traps work like standard traps, except once
            activated they execute a series of actions each round. A
            complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into
            something more like a combat encounter.
          </para>
          <para>
            When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The
            trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its
            turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It
            might make successive attacks against intruders, create an
            effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a
            dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be
            detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.

            For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works

            The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches

            disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without
            thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage
            using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the

          <para>
            Four basic pit traps are presented here.
          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Simple
            Pit</emphasis></emphasis>. A simple pit trap is a hole dug
            in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored
            on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.
          </para>
          <para>
            The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth
            falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking
            damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some
            pits are deeper).
          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Hidden
            Pit</emphasis></emphasis>. This pit has a cover constructed
            from material identical to the floor around it.
          </para>
          <para>
            A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an
            absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms
            the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence
            (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the
            trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.
          </para>
          <para>
            When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a
            trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below.
            The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.
          </para>
          <para>
            Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar
            object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the
            surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from
            opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also
            be magically held shut using the <emphasis>arcane
            lock</emphasis> spell or similar magic.
          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Locking
            Pit</emphasis></emphasis>. This pit trap is identical to a
            hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that
            covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into
            the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.
          </para>
          <para>
            A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the
            cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character
            in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism
            from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’
            tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the
            character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually
            hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.
          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Spiked
            Pit</emphasis></emphasis>. This pit trap is a simple,
            hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron
            spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes
            11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to
            any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison
            smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing
            damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution
            saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed
            save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

          </para>
          <para>
            When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate,
            poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized
            tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area
            might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to
            its own set of darts.
          </para>
          <para>
            The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and
            cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or
            frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15.
            With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check,
            a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate
            from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it,
            compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or
            other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from
            activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents
            the darts contained within from launching.
          </para>
          <para>
            The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is
            placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each
            dart makes a ranged attack with a +8
          </para>
          <para>
            bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure
            plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there
            are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A
            target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must
            succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11
            (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
            damage on a successful one.

          <para>
            A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock,
            or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the
            chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring
            out, delivering a dose of poison.
          </para>
          <para>
            When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches
            straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1
            piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must
            succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned
            for 1 hour.
          </para>
          <para>
            A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows
            a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations
            made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC
            15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap,
            removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting
            to pick the lock triggers the trap.

            <emphasis>Mechanical trap</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>
            When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s
            pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens,
            releasing a 10-foot diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.
          </para>
          <para>
            With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a
            character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search
            of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence
            (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and
            stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same
            check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in
            the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron
            spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the
            trap from activating.
          </para>
          <para>
            Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to
            roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8
            bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The
            sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can
            move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain.
            Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature
            enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must
            succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10)
            bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
          </para>
          <para>
            The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It
            can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders
            incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that
            allow the sphere to keep moving.
          </para>
          <para>
            As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can
            attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a
            successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet.
            If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no
            longer a threat.

          <para>
            Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a
            stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in

            A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that
            the mouth contains a <emphasis>sphere of

        A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest
        to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb,
        unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a

        a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.

        A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain
        on party resources, curable by a casting of <emphasis>lesser

      </para>
      <para>
        A disease that does more than infect a few party members is
        primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of
        the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a
        disease works aren’t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases
        can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not
        pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague
        might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a
        halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What
        matters is the story you want to tell.

            This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are
            strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease,
            victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving
            the disease its common name and its morbid nickname:
            <quote>the shrieks.</quote>

          <para>
            Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include
            fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one
            level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease
            is cured.
          </para>
          <para>
            Any event that causes the infected creature great
            stress-including entering combat, taking damage,
            experiencing fear, or having a nightmare-forces the creature
            to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
            the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes
            incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature
            can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
            ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a
            success.

          <para>
            Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of
            an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must
            succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become
            infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this
            save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular
            infected creature for 24 hours.

          <para>
            At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make

            DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad
            laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0,
            the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that
            fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly
            determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in
            this chapter.

          <para>
            Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of
            illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and
            stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by
            creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and
            otyughs.

          <para>
            When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that
            carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with
            filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature
            must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become
            infected.

          <para>
            It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in
            an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps.
            The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and
            it regains only half the normal number of hit points from
            spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long
            rest.

          <para>
            At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make
            a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
            character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful
            save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one
            level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected
            creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature

          <para>
            A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot
            must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become

            starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to
            attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the
            end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty
            worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded
            until its sight is restored by magic such as

            has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower
            into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long
            rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening
            after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the
            disease entirely.

        In a typical campaign, characters aren’t driven mad by the
        horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day,
        but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much
        to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might
        want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme,

          insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of
          the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and
          planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of
          Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also

          Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most
          relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which
          lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or
          cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite
          madness.

        When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or
        smash a vampire’s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this:
        given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy
        any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a
        character’s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut
        through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is
        likely to break before the wall does.
      </para>
      <para>
        For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete,
        inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair,
        or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many
        other objects.

          When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit
          points to a destructible object. You can also give it
          immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types
          of damage.

          <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Huge and Gargantuan
          Objects</emphasis></emphasis>. Normal weapons are of little
          use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a
          colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder.
          That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an
          <emphasis>earthquake</emphasis> spell can reduce a colossus to
          rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points
          if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can
          withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If
          you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or
          smaller sections, and track each section’s hit points
          separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the
          entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human
          might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0
          hit points.

          psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are
          more effective against a particular object or substance than
          others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for
          smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather.
          Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and
          lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can’t
          effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best
          judgment.

          walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage
          threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to
          all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single
          attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage
          threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage
          that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is

      <para>
        Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in
        most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow,
        and other evil creatures.
      </para>
      <para>
        Poisons come in the following four types.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Contact</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent
        until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches
        contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Ingested</emphasis></emphasis>.
        A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to
        suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a
        liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect,
        such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only
        half damage on a failed save.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Inhaled</emphasis></emphasis>.
        These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when
        inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects
        creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud
        dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is
        ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal
        membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Injury</emphasis></emphasis>.
        Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap
        components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing
        damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or
        washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage
        from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

          <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Assassin’s Blood
          (Ingested)</emphasis></emphasis>. A creature subjected to this
          poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a
          failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned
          for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half
          damage and isn’t poisoned.

          take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw
          at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed
          save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. After three
          successful saves, the poison ends.
        </para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Crawler Mucus
          (Contact)</emphasis></emphasis>. This poison must be harvested
          from a dead or incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to
          this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw
          or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is
          paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
          of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
          success.
        </para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Drow Poison
          (Injury)</emphasis></emphasis>. This poison is typically made
          only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from
          sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on
          a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.
          If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also
          unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up
          if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to
          shake it awake.

          poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must
          succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6)
          poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
          successful one.

          take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned
          creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3
          (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends,
          the damage the poison deals can’t be healed by any means.
          After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the

        This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel
        weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be
        found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation)
        check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the
        barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl
        inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a
        neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain
        levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant
        lobster.
      </para>

        The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following

      </para>
      <para>
        To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While
        the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and
        watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of
        breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
      </para>
      <para>
        The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a
        depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning
        damage per minute from pressure.
      </para>
      <para>
        A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many
        as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a
        lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left
        to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers
        table.

        This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an

        An <emphasis>arrow of slaying</emphasis> is a magic weapon meant

        than others; for example, there are both <emphasis>arrows of

        slaying</emphasis>. If a creature belonging to the type, race,

        must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra

        damage on a successful one.

                pyramid is treated as the mummy lord’s lair, and its
                sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM’s choice.

      <title>Bag of Devouring</title>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Wondrous item, very rare</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        This bag superficially resembles a <emphasis>bag of
        holding</emphasis> but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic
        extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the
        orifice.
      </para>
      <para>
        The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense
        whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter
        placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part
        of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when
        someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the
        creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can
        use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength
        check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag
        to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20
        Strength check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first).
        Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured,
        its body destroyed.
      </para>
      <para>
        Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a
        cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag
        swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another
        plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything
        contained within it is transported to a random location on the
        Astral Plane.

      <para>
        <emphasis>Wondrous item, uncommon</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its
        outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and
        4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a
        volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of
        its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an
        action.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is
        destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane.
        If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth,
        unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used
        again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a
        number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures
        (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

      <para>
        Placing a <emphasis>bag of holding</emphasis> inside an
        extradimensional space created by a <emphasis>handy
        haversack</emphasis>, <emphasis>portable hole</emphasis>, or
        similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to
        the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was
        placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate
        is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane.
        The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be
        reopened.

      <para>
        This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears
        empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of
        a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and
        throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms
        into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the
        table that corresponds to the bag’s color.
      </para>
      <para>
        The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts
        on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the
        creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to
        give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the
        absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion
        appropriate to its nature.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag
        can’t be used again until the next dawn.

      <para>
        This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and
        weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4+4 <emphasis>beads of
        force</emphasis> are found together.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead
        explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a
        10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15
        Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of
        transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any
        creature that failed the save and is completely within the area
        is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the
        save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the
        center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only
        breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or
        other effect can.
      </para>
      <para>
        An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the
        sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s
        walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes
        it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures
        inside.

        You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Curse</emphasis></emphasis>.
        This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse
        to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part
        with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also
        have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this
        one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or

        Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your
        possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
        go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round
        to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can
        make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those
        extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after
        you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible
        targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you

        The candle’s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which

        While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any

        charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use an action to press one of the cube’s faces,
        expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown
        in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different
        effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing
        happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into
        existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is
        centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until
        you use an action to press the cube’s sixth face, or the cube
        runs out of charges. You can change the barrier’s effect by
        pressing a different face of the cube and expending the
        requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.

      <para>
        This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical
        energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different
        plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The
        other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the
        <emphasis>gate</emphasis> spell with it, opening a portal to the
        plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to
        press one side twice, you can cast the <emphasis>plane
        shift</emphasis> spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport
        the targets to the plane keyed to that side.
      </para>
      <para>
        The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge.
        The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

      </para>
      <para>
        You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the
        blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using
        this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC
        15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and
        become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can’t be used this way
        again until the next dawn.

      </para>
      <para>
        You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air
        and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to
        hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your
        choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and
        ability score modifier to damage rolls.
      </para>
      <para>
        While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it
        to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As
        part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack
        one creature within 5 feet of it.
      </para>
      <para>
        After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies
        up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no
        hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has
        no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can
        and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you
        grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.

        You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of
        three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt
        water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops
        pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the

            geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The
            target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take
            1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a

      <title>Deck of Illusions</title>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Wondrous item, uncommon</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34
        cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20-1 cards.
      </para>
      <para>
        The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at
        random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate
        the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from
        the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of
        you.
      </para>
      <para>
        An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card
        and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real,
        of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real
        creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120
        feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an
        action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card.
        Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it
        to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who
        uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as
        illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
        check. The creature then appears translucent.
      </para>
      <para>
        The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is
        dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card
        disappears, and that card can’t be used again.

      <para>
        <emphasis>Wondrous item, legendary</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of
        cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks
        have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.
      </para>
      <para>
        Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you
        intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an
        altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards
        drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as
        soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect.
        You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous
        draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining
        number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect
        all at once.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card
        is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck,
        making it possible to draw the same card twice.

        Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment

        You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck
        again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If

        You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a

        All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic

        buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters
        reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own
        something lost to this card also disappears.

        You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad
        in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It
        appears in a space of the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and
        attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle
        alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit
        points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you,
        the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by
        an avatar of death can’t be restored to life.

        Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon.

        Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle,
        which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the
        stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius
        from the bottle. The cloud’s area is heavily obscured. Each
        minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius
        increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120
        feet.
      </para>
      <para>
        The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the
        bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once
        the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A
        moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the
        smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per
        hour) can do so after 1 round.

        You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Bird</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The
        token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its
        place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your
        simple commands and can’t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds
        while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a
        maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3
        hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird
        disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it
        drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.

        giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a
        wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its
        speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan
        as an action.

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Swan
        Boat</emphasis></emphasis>. You can use an action to touch the

        disappears, and a 50-foot long, 20-foot wide boat shaped like a
        swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves
        across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an
        action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to
        90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or
        smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium
        creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat
        remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the
        boat as an action.

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Tree</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to
        touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token
        disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into
        existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot diameter
        trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot
        radius.

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Whip</emphasis></emphasis>.
        You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10
        feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its
        place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell
        attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an
        attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6+5 force
        damage.
      </para>
      <para>
        As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly
        up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10
        feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an
        action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.

      <para>
        A <emphasis>figurine of wondrous power</emphasis> is a statuette
        of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action
        to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on
        the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living
        creature. If the space where the creature would appear is
        occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough
        space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.
      </para>
      <para>
        The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It
        understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If
        you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no
        other actions.

      <para>
        The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At
        the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine
        form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points
        or if you use an action to speak the command word again while
        touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its
        property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has
        passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.

              The <emphasis>goat of terror</emphasis> becomes a giant
              goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but you can
              remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes
              a <emphasis>+1 lance</emphasis>, and the other becomes a

              requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the
              horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In
              addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot radius aura of
              terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to
              you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC
              15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1
              minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The

              of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
              success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a

        On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and

        You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the

        The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet
        high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it.
        Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running
        along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor

        which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the

        either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space
        outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that

      <para>
        <emphasis>Wondrous item, rare</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs
        1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and
        throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see
        within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it
        opens into a tangle of metal bands.
      </para>
      <para>
        Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your
        Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the
        target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the
        command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the
        attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once
        more.
      </para>
      <para>
        A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to
        make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a
        success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is
        freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that
        creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next
        dawn.

      <title>Iron Flask</title>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Wondrous item, legendary</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to
        speak the flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you
        can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a
        plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must
        succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the
        flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it
        has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature
        remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one
        creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need
        to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release
        the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you
        and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that
        duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is
        likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise
        takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts
        in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.
      </para>
      <para>
        An <emphasis>identify</emphasis> spell reveals that a creature
        is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of
        creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might
        already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined
        randomly.

      <para>
        This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its
        command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a
        line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within
        120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target
        must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning
        damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful
        one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it
        reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the
        target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus
        4d6 lightning damage.
      </para>
      <para>
        The javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

        must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
        of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a
        creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
        you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30
        feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it
        can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect
        that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the
        creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its

        To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table,
        working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting
        no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified
        cost to purchase supplies.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in
        eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the
        manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it
        understands and obeys your spoken commands.

        This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its
        words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a
        period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and
        practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2,
        as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its

      <title>Marvelous Pigments</title>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Wondrous item, very rare</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a
        brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to
        create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two
        dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired
        object as you concentrate on its image.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a
        surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain
        features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or
        weapons - that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes
        to cover 100 square feet.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature
        depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a
        door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to
        whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real
        pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you
        create.
      </para>
      <para>
        Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25
        gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond
        or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close
        inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other
        worthless material.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the
        energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the
        painting, doing no harm to anything.

      <para>
        <emphasis>Wondrous item, very rare</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        When this 4-foot tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface
        shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds,
        and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to
        bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to
        0 hit points.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are
        within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command
        word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an
        action to speak the command word again.
      </para>
      <para>
        Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the
        activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC
        15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it
        is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve
        extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage
        if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs
        succeed on the saving throw automatically.
      </para>
      <para>
        An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with
        thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped
        in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat,
        drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape
        using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature
        is confined to the cell until freed.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional
        cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped
        creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed
        creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the
        mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all
        creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces
        near it.
      </para>
      <para>
        While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to
        speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a
        particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in
        the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You
        and the creature can then communicate normally.
      </para>
      <para>
        In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second
        command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The
        freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the
        unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

        This necklace has 1d4+2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black
        pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from
        stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl,
        or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that
        bead loses its magic.
      </para>
      <para>
        Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each
        bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can
        have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must
        be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can
        cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a
        save is necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that bead
        can’t be used again until the next dawn.

        but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or
        smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and
        carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category
        above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected
        creature then gains the effect of a <emphasis>freedom of
        movement</emphasis> spell for 8 hours.

        Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action,

        You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes.
        While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats
        are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you
        threaten or harm them.
      </para>
      <para>
        The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action,
        you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling
        forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that
        enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this
        fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats
        to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward
        the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your
        control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily
        at dawn.
      </para>
      <para>
        Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s
        control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the
        pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s
        Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it
        normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the
        next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by
        the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions
        for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an
        action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no
        commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise
        takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t
        hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and
        the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by
        the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.

        You can use an action to unfold a <emphasis>portable

        whereupon the <emphasis>portable hole</emphasis> creates an
        extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within
        the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to

        You can use an action to close a <emphasis>portable

        For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points

        If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must

        turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save,
        the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by
        1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.

        While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows
        other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are
        lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type.
        Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you
        allow it.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use an action to cause the ring to become invisible
        until you use another action to make it visible, until you
        remove the ring, or until you die.

        If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless
        it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart
        for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can
        telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A
        wearer can’t prevent this telepathic communication.

        sphere is individually.
      </para>

        Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within
        120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as
        if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds
        dim light in a 30-foot radius.

      <para>
        As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but
        no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other
        than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges
        lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must
        make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
        creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres
        you created.

        This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges
        daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and
        expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting
        pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During
        this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and
        dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you
        have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any
        creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe’s
        power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw
        or become stunned until the effect ends.

      <para>
        <emphasis>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a
        spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect.
        The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s
        energy-not the spell itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has
        the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb
        and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its
        existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t
        absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t
        store, the rod has no effect on that spell.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of
        energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence,
        and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy
        stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared
        or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or
        lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level.
        You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise
        cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels
        stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.
      </para>
      <para>
        A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it
        already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no
        energy remaining becomes nonmagical.

        This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace

        The rod has properties associated with six different buttons
        that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other

        If you press <emphasis role="strong">button 4</emphasis>, the

        and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3
        inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a
        ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or

        If you press <emphasis role="strong">button 6</emphasis>, the

        by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary
        to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The
        rod can’t be used again until the next dawn.

      <para>
        <emphasis>Rod, very rare</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it.
        The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other
        willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an
        extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes.
        It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern,
        immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever
        else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise
        contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors.
        Everything else that can be interacted with inside the
        extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower
        picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken
        outside the extraplanar space.
      </para>
      <para>
        For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit
        points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age
        while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors
        can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the
        number of creatures present (round down).
      </para>
      <para>
        When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all
        visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you
        activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location.
        The rod can’t be used again until ten days have passed.

      </para>
      <para>
        This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up
        to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an
        action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus
        action, you can command the other end to move toward a
        destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when
        you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until
        reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or
        until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten
        itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or
        unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot
        intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a
        50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.
      </para>
      <para>
        The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point
        every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the
        rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

      <para>
        This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one
        end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the
        other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see
        within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15
        Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a
        second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an
        action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s
        choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by
        the rope.
      </para>
      <para>
        The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point

      <para>
        A <emphasis>spell scroll</emphasis> bears the words of a single
        spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your
        class’s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and
        cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell’s
        components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level
        than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using
        your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it
        successfully. The DC equals 10+the spell’s level. On a failed
        check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other
        effect. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade,
        and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.
      </para>
      <para>
        The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s

        On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within
        60 feet of you and you aren’t incapacitated. You decide what
        action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn,
        or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your
        enemies or guard a location.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to
        its staff form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the
        snake reverts to staff form before losing all its hit points, it
        regains all of them.

        minute, you know the direction of the nearest creature hostile
        to you within 60 feet, but not its distance from you. The wand
        can sense the presence of hostile creatures that are ethereal,
        invisible, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain
        sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.

        60-foot cone of amber light. Each creature in the cone must
        succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of
        you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature
        must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it
        can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of
        you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use
        only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that
        prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the
        creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its
        turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect
        on itself on a success.

                If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15
                Constitution saving throw. If you didn’t target a
                creature, you become the target and must make the saving
                throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the
                target is instantly petrified. On any other failed save,
                the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone.
                While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the
                saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming
                petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a
                success. The petrification lasts until the target is
                freed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

    <para>
      Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item
      might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or
      self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the
      item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks,
      ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a
      cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.
    </para>
    <para>
      Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest
      sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are
      never sentient.
    </para>
    <para>
      Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any
      activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not
      its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good
      relationship with the item, the wielder can access those
      properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can
      suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the
      wielder.

          You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps
          to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of
          the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains
          cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict

          A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its
          personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner
          opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can
          arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma
          check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item
          wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following
          demands:

          If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder,

          to 12+the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the
          wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed,
          the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the
          wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending
          the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its
          user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again
          until the next dawn.

        <emphasis>Wondrous item, artifact (requires
        attunement)</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil
        dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came
        together and worked their greatest magic, forging five
        <emphasis>Orbs of Dragonkind</emphasis> (or <emphasis>Dragon
        Orbs</emphasis>) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was
        taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were
        used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used
        the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons
        with powerful magic.
      </para>
      <para>
        As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed
        or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive.
        Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so
        although their primary purpose of calling dragons still
        functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that
        resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in
        force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.
      </para>
      <para>
        An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter.
        When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist
        swirls inside it.
      </para>
      <para>
        While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the
        orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC
        15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb
        for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you
        become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to
        it.
      </para>
      <para>
        While you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your
        attunement to it, and the orb casts
        <emphasis>suggestion</emphasis> on you at will (save DC 18),
        urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon
        essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation
        of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread
        suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or
        something else the GM decides.

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Spells</emphasis></emphasis>.
        The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily
        at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and
        expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells
        (save DC 18) from it: <emphasis>cure wounds</emphasis>
        (5th-level version, 3 charges), <emphasis>daylight</emphasis> (1
        charge), <emphasis>death ward</emphasis> (2 charges), or
        <emphasis>scrying</emphasis> (3 charges).
      </para>

        You can also use an action to cast the <emphasis>detect

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Call
        Dragons</emphasis></emphasis>. While you control the orb, you
        can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic
        call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons
        in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible
        by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are
        unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be
        hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once
        you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.

      <para>
        A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain
        spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the
        game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular
        type. For example, an <emphasis>arrow of dragon
        slaying</emphasis> deals extra damage not only to dragons but
        also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles
        and wyverns.
      </para>
      <para>
        The game includes the following monster types, which have no
        rules of their own.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Aberrations</emphasis> are utterly alien
        beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from
        the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the
        world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders,
        mind flayers, and slaadi.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Beasts</emphasis> are nonhumanoid
        creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some
        of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack
        any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of
        ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Celestials</emphasis> are creatures
        native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of
        deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm
        and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the
        exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a
        horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and
        pegasi.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Constructs</emphasis> are made, not
        born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple
        set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and
        capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic
        constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of
        Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw
        material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Dragons</emphasis> are large reptilian
        creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons,
        including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic
        dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in
        this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons,
        but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as
        wyverns and pseudodragons.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Elementals</emphasis> are creatures
        native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are
        little more than animate masses of their respective elements,
        including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have
        biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of
        genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important
        civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures
        include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Fey</emphasis> are magical creatures
        closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight
        groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied
        to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also
        found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea
        and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Fiends</emphasis> are creatures of
        wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the
        servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of
        archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes
        summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an
        evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost
        inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds,
        rakshasas, and yugoloths.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Giants</emphasis> tower over humans and
        their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have
        multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six
        varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost
        giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides
        these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Humanoids</emphasis> are the main
        peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage,
        including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They
        have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities
        (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal
        form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable
        as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings.
        Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost
        uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins,
        hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and
        kobolds.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Monstrosities</emphasis> are monsters in
        the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary,
        not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results
        of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and
        others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs
        and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve
        as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any
        other type.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Oozes</emphasis> are gelatinous
        creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly
        subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on
        refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their
        way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most
        recognizable oozes.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Plants</emphasis> in this context are
        vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are
        ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants
        are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as
        the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Undead</emphasis> are once-living
        creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the
        practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead
        include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well
        as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

      <section xml:id="tags">
        <title>Tags</title>
        <para>
          A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in
          parentheses. For example, an orc has the <emphasis>humanoid
          (orc)</emphasis> type. The parenthetical tags provide
          additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have
          no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a
          magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is
          especially effective at fighting demons would work against any

      <title>Alignment</title>
      <para>
        A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how
        it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a
        chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might
        attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be
        willing to negotiate. See the <emphasis>Player’s
        Handbook</emphasis> for descriptions of the different
        alignments.
      </para>
      <para>
        The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the
        default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster’s
        alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a
        good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s
        nothing stopping you.
      </para>
      <para>
        Some creatures can have <emphasis role="strong">any
        alignment</emphasis>. In other words, you choose the monster’s
        alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency
        or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a
        berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic
        neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.
      </para>
      <para>
        Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law
        or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical
        choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are
        <emphasis role="strong">unaligned</emphasis>, which means they
        don’t have an alignment.

    <section xml:id="armor-class-1">
      <title>Armor Class</title>
      <para>
        A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor
        Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into
        account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity
        modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural
        armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in
        parentheses after its AC value.

      <title>Hit Points</title>
      <para>
        A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit
        points. For more on hit points, see the <emphasis>Player’s
        Handbook</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <para>
        A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression
        and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit
        points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).
      </para>
      <para>
        A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit
        points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.

      <para>
        A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit
        points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the
        number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its
        hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12
        (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8+2 hit points (average
        11).

      <title>Skills</title>
      <para>
        The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in
        one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very
        perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom
        (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
      </para>
      <para>
        A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability
        modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the
        monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by
        Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For
        instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus
        (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its
        heightened expertise.

      <para>
        Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to
        certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant
        or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is
        an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical
        source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain
        conditions.

      <title>Senses</title>
      <para>
        The Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception)
        score, as well as any special senses the monster might have.
        Special senses are described below.

      <section xml:id="blindsight-1">
        <title>Blindsight</title>
        <para>
          A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings
          without relying on sight, within a specific radius.
        </para>
        <para>
          Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes,
          typically have this special sense, as do creatures with
          echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true
          dragons.
        </para>
        <para>
          If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note
          to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight
          defines the maximum range of its perception.

        <para>
          A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a
          specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the
          radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it
          were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in darkness,
          only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have
          this special sense.

        <title>Tremorsense</title>
        <para>
          A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin
          of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the
          monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with
          the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to
          detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing
          creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special
          sense.

          normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and
          objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on
          saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of
          a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.
          Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane
          within the same range.

      <para>
        The languages that a monster can speak are listed in
        alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a
        language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A

      <section xml:id="telepathy">
        <title>Telepathy</title>
        <para>
          Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to
          communicate mentally with another creature within a specified
          range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language
          with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it
          must be able to understand at least one language. A creature
          without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic
          messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic
          conversation.
        </para>
        <para>
          A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature
          and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is
          broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range
          of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a
          different creature within range. A telepathic monster can
          initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using
          an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t
          initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is
          terminated.

      <title>Challenge</title>
      <para>
        A monster’s <emphasis role="strong">Challenge rating</emphasis>
        tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately
        equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be
        able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to
        its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of
        four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge
        rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.
      </para>
      <para>
        Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level
        characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a
        challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers;
        those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points,
        while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.
      </para>
      <para>
        Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical
        20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge
        rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test
        player skill.
      </para>
      <section xml:id="experience-points-1">
        <title>Experience Points</title>
        <para>
          The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is
          based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for
          defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for
          neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other
          manner.
        </para>
        <para>
          Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a
          spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its
          stat block.

      <title>Special Traits</title>
      <para>
        Special traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating
        but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that
        are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require
        some explanation.
      </para>
      <section xml:id="innate-spellcasting">
        <title>Innate Spellcasting</title>
        <para>
          A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the
          Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an
          innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its
          lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. If
          a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level
          is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.
        </para>
        <para>
          An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For
          example, a drow mage can innately cast the
          <emphasis>levitate</emphasis> spell, but the spell has a
          <quote>self only</quote> restriction, which means that the
          spell affects only the drow mage.
        </para>
        <para>
          A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other
          spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t require attack
          rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.
        </para>

      <section xml:id="spellcasting-9">
        <title>Spellcasting</title>
        <para>
          A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a
          spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its
          spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the
          <emphasis>Player’s Handbook</emphasis>). The spellcaster level
          is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.
        </para>
        <para>
          The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a
          specific class. The list might also include spells from a
          feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of
          the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The
          monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to
          or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or
          access to its spell list.
        </para>
        <para>
          A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if
          it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with
          the 3rd-level <emphasis>lightning bolt</emphasis> spell can
          cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level
          greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge
          rating.

        <para>
          A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind
          has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate
          Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules
          of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A
          monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any
          components to cast its spells.

        A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or

        clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed
        appropriately.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however
        you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is
        recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that
        equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a
        monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.
      </para>

        creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the

        magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must

          17 (2d10+6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10+6) slashing
          damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the behir
          isn’t already constricting a creature, and the target is
          restrained until this grapple ends.

        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Lightning Breath (Recharge
          5-6)</emphasis></emphasis>. The behir exhales a line of
          lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature
          in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking
          66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
          damage on a successful one.
        </para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Swallow</emphasis></emphasis>.
          The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller
          target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also
          swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target
          is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks
          and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6)
          acid damage at the start of each of the behir’s turns. A behir
          can have only one creature swallowed at a time.
        </para>
        <para>
          If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the
          swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14
          Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or
          regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within
          10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature
          is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse
          by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

            damage dealt by the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any
            creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a
            successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also
            closes if the target receives magical healing.

            <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Wall of Ice (Recharge

            opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60
            feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long
            and 10 feet high, or it’s a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet
            in diameter.
          </para>
          <para>
            When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed
            out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which
            side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is
            incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity
            saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save,
            or half as much damage on a successful one.
          </para>
          <para>
            The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is
            incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached;
            each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability
            to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic,
            poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it
            leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall
            occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the
            frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature
            must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6)
            cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
            successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of
            the wall vanishes.

          The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that
          resembles a rat (speed 20 ft.), a raven (20 ft., fly 60 ft.),
          or a spider (20 ft., climb 20 ft.), or back into its true
          form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the
          speed changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
          isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

        The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or
        Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its
        statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any
        equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It
        reverts to its true form if it dies.

          reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of
          it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or
          dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of
          lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger
          can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the
          doppelganger’s concentration isn’t broken (as if concentrating
          on a spell). While reading the target’s mind, the doppelganger
          has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception,
          Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.

          each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself
          on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the
          effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost’s
          Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can
          be reversed with a <emphasis>greater restoration</emphasis>
          spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Possession (Recharge
          6)</emphasis></emphasis>. One humanoid that the ghost can see
          within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving
          throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears,
          and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body.
          The ghost now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target
          of awareness. The ghost can’t be targeted by any attack,
          spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it
          retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and
          immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses
          the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to
          the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
        </para>
        <para>
          The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the
          ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or
          forced out by an effect like the <emphasis>dispel evil and
          good</emphasis> spell. When the possession ends, the ghost
          reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.
          The target is immune to this ghost’s Possession for 24 hours
          after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession
          ends.

        melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its

            The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to
            physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to
            have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her
            rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to
            visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20
            Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag
            is disguised.

            invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage,
            so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears
            or carries is invisible with her.

          Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can
          hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or
          be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus
          action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can
          stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is
          incapacitated.

        <para>
          While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and
          ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is
          more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on
          its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to
          get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but
          before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit,
          and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the
          harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed
          target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
          its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends
          on it.

        <para>
          A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s
          song for the next 24 hours.

        <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Petrifying
        Gaze</emphasis></emphasis>. When a creature that can see the
        medusa’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the
        medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if
        the medusa isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the
        saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly
        petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to
        turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must
        repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming
        petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The
        petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the
        <emphasis>greater restoration</emphasis> spell or other magic.
      </para>
      <para>
        Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the
        saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so,
        it can’t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when
        it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa
        in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within
        30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due
        to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

            <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Dreadful
            Glare</emphasis></emphasis>. The mummy lord targets one
            creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can
            see the mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving
            throw against this magic or become frightened until the end
            of the mummy’s next turn. If the target fails the saving
            throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same
            duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is
            immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy lords
            for the next 24 hours.

            lord that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a
            DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end

            into a whirlwind of sand, moves up to 60 feet, and reverts
            to its normal form. While in whirlwind form, the mummy lord
            is immune to all damage, and it can’t be grappled,
            petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned. Equipment
            worn or carried by the mummy lord remain in its possession.

          disadvantage on the saving throw.

        <para>
          A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to
          pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a
          successful DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the
          attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.
        </para>

          The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium

          Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC

          moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube’s
          space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.

            The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter
            Large or smaller creatures’ spaces. Whenever the cube enters
            a creature’s space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity
            saving throw.
          </para>
          <para>
            On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5
            feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that
            chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a
            failed saving throw.
          </para>
          <para>
            On a failed save, the cube enters the creature’s space, and
            the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The
            engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 21
            (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube’s turns.
            When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.
          </para>
          <para>
            An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action
            to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature
            escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of
            the cube.

        The shield guardian is magically bound to an amulet. As long as
        the guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence,
        the amulet’s wearer can telepathically call the guardian to
        travel to it, and the guardian knows the distance and direction
        to the amulet. If the guardian is within 60 feet of the amulet’s
        wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes (rounded up) is
        transferred to the guardian.

        The shield guardian regains 10 hit points at the start of its

        Storing</emphasis></emphasis>. A spellcaster who wears the
        shield guardian’s amulet can cause the guardian to store one
        spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the wearer must cast the
        spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is stored
        within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or
        when a situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster,
        the guardian casts the stored spell with any parameters set by
        the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is
        cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is
        lost.

          it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside

          regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a

          If the vampire isn’t in sunlight or running water, it can use

          mist, or back into its true form.

        <para>
          While in bat form, the vampire can’t speak, its walking speed
          is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its
          statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged.
          Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is
          carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
        </para>
        <para>
          While in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak,
          or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of
          20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space
          and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space,
          the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can’t pass
          through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and
          Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical
          damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

          of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling
          unconscious, provided that it isn’t in sunlight or running
          water. If it can’t transform, it is destroyed.

        <para>
          While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its
          vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2
          hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts
          to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at
          least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place
          with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.

            The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet

            succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or
            be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the
            vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected.

            takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most

          poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that
          elapse, the creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing
          its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. This reduction
          lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the
          disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

          A <emphasis role="strong">death dog</emphasis> is an ugly
          two-headed hound that roams plains, and deserts. Hate burns in
          a death dog’s heart, and a taste for humanoid flesh drives it
          to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries a
          foul disease that causes a victim’s flesh to slowly rot off
          the bone.

          The majestic <emphasis role="strong">giant elk</emphasis> is
          rare to the point that its appearance is often taken as a
          foreshadowing of an important event, such as the birth of a

          A <emphasis role="strong">giant fire beetle</emphasis> is a
          nocturnal creature that takes its name from a pair of glowing
          glands that give off light. Miners and adventurers prize these
          creatures, for a giant fire beetle’s glands continue to shed
          light for 1d6 days after the beetle dies. Giant fire beetles
          are most commonly found underground and in dark forests.

          The frog makes one bite attack against a Small or smaller

          other effects outside the frog, and it takes 5 (2d4) acid
          damage at the start of each of the frog’s turns. The frog can
          have only one target swallowed at a time.

          The toad makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller
          target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is
          swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is
          blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and
          other effects outside the toad, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid
          damage at the start of each of the toad’s turns. The toad can
          have only one target swallowed at a time.
        </para>
        <para>
          If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained
          by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement,
          exiting prone.

        If the tiger moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature
        and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that
        target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be
        knocked prone. If the target is prone, the tiger can make one
        bite attack against it as a bonus action.

        If the tiger moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature
        and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that
        target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be
        knocked prone. If the target is prone, the tiger can make one
        bite attack against it as a bonus action.

    <title>Customizing NPCs</title>
    <para>
      There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix
      for your home campaign.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Racial
      Traits</emphasis></emphasis>. You can add racial traits to an NPC.
      For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and
      the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its
      challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the
      <emphasis>Player’s Handbook</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Spell
      Swaps</emphasis></emphasis>. One way to customize an NPC
      spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can
      substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different
      spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells
      in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge rating.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Armor and Weapon
      Swaps</emphasis></emphasis>. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s
      armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and
      damage can change an NPC’s challenge rating.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>Magic
      Items</emphasis></emphasis>. The more powerful an NPC, the more
      likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An
      archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well
      as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent
      damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.

        The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would

        It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver
        tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The

        qualities in spades.

        In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the
        <emphasis role="strong">pirate captain</emphasis> is a variation
        of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To

      </para>
      <para>
        More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves
        infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain’s vanity or ego is
        more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or
        claims not to know anything of the captain’s colorful
        reputation.

        <emphasis role="strong">Knights</emphasis> are warriors who
        pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A

        knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and
        hirelings who are commoners.
